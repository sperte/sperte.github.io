<p>Apple has just released an update for iTunes. In the release notes it touts its new &#8220;support for the Second Generation iPod shuffle&#8221;. I find that interesting because iTunes 7.0.1 (the previous version) supports my new shuffle just fine &#8211; everything besides the color.</p>

<p>So, what would you expect &#8220;support for&#8221; to mean? Yeah me too. But apparently it doesn&#8217;t. <a href="/entry/reepicheep">Reepicheep</a> is still silver.</p>
