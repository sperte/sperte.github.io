<p>There is currently a form of malware (if you can call it that) for the Mac circulating, called MAC Defender. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/05/malware-on-the-mac.ars/">Ars Technica has a report about its affects</a>, which, so far, are both interesting and alarming. Interesting in that the malware is actually posing as malware <em>protection</em> for the Mac. And alarming because, despite the Mac security model of requiring an admin password, MAC Defender is actually shaping up to be a pretty big problem with casual users. Ars quotes an Apple Store Genius:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The beauty of Mac OS X is its security model. That people blindly enter a password is going to be the undoing of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not a big deal if you&#8217;re a smart and safe Mac user. You should rarely have to enter your admin password to install any software anyway, so when you&#8217;re prompted, you should always be 100% sure of the software&#8217;s origin and purpose.</p>

<p>What you need to know/do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do not install anything that requires your password without being absolutely sure of its origins. (This is Rule #1 for protection anyway.)</li>
<li>Do not believe any on-screen reports that your Mac has been &#8220;infected&#8221;.</li>
<li>Uncheck the &#8220;Open &#8216;Safe&#8217; Files&#8221; preference in Safari</li>
</ol>
