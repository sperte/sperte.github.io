<p>Today I recorded my screen as I created a PowerPoint splash screen (or title screen) for a message series by our youth pastor. This is the sort of project I do regularly at <a href="http://thecity.org">The City Church</a> &#8211; especially for Generation Church.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to both document and share the video:</p>

<p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7444265&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7444265&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="560" height="315"></embed></object></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll notice a short pause after I launch Safari &#8211; it was inexplicably unresponsive.</li>
<li>I use a lot of shortcuts &#8211; especially in Photoshop &#8211; from muscle-memory. I apologize if it&#8217;s hard to follow at times.</li>
<li>I use a technique for building the title layer in order to treat it which keeps the &#8220;build&#8221; still available for editing &#8211; hence the hidden folder layer in the final document.</li>
<li>I was surprised how quick and easy it was to find a perfect (free) font for the project. I expected to have to cut out a portion of the video while I searched for the right font. </li>
</ul>
