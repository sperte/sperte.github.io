<p>Anyone else notice that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seansperte/242636557/">the show Friends was featured in the &#8220;Showtime&#8221; presentation</a> yesterday? I couldn&#8217;t find it on the iTunes Store &#8230; is it available?</p>

<p class="update">UPDATE: And where&#8217;s the NFL Network?</p>
