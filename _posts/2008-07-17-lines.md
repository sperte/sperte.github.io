<p>So I just got back from the local Apple Store (empty-handed thanks to their policy about requiring the primary account holder to be present, yadda yadda &#8211; don&#8217;t get me started), and I thought I&#8217;d post this bit of interesting info about people lining up for the iPhone 3G.</p>

<p>It seems that the lines (which, by the way, are <em>still</em> insanely long &#8211; I mean, does anyone else not see how absolutely crazy this is?) are less because of the overall demand and more because of the slow exercise of activating the device. An employee even told me they only had only two personnel assigned to the job of activations, and admitted that&#8217;s the reason for the long waits.</p>

<p>So are they spiting AT&amp;T, or their customers, with that strategy? Two employees? Really, Apple? Do you realize what people are doing for these iPhone thingies?</p>
