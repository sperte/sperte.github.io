<p>Just in time for the holiday season, Apple&#8217;s finally addressed the horrible UI shortcoming of multiple song management in iTunes. It used to be (versions prior to 5) that you had to manually check and uncheck songs <em>individually</em>. This proved a massive dilemma when enabling or disabling Christmas music or spoken-word content.</p>

<p>Now, however, iTunes allows multiple songs to be checked or unchecked using the contextual menu. Just highlight the songs you&#8217;d like to manage, right-click (or control+click) and select either &#8220;Check Selection&#8221; or &#8220;Uncheck Selection&#8221;. This will prove to be one of my favorite new features of version 5.</p>

<p>When December hits, I&#8217;ll be ready with my holiday music.</p>
