<p>I guess having <a href="http://www.thecity.org/audio/podcast">two podcasts</a> (one video, one audio) maintain rankings in the Top 100 of Religious podcasts (on the iTunes Music Store) doesn&#8217;t come without it&#8217;s drawbacks. Sheesh!</p>

<p>(That&#8217;s 1.3 <em>terabytes</em>, just so you know.) So, allow me a moment to remind everyone: Podcasts eat a <em>ton</em> of bandwidth.</p>

<p>Thank you, that&#8217;s all.</p>
