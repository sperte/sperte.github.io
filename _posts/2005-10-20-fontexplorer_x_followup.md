<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.31three.com/" title="Jesse">Jesse</a>, I&#8217;ve had somewhat of a breakthrough with my font situation. I&#8217;m now proud to report that my fonts are all organized, optimized and dutifully managed via FontExplorer X.</p>

<p>I think what it took was a little trust on my part. See, when a user&#8217;s so used to managing files the hard way, once a new (more intuitive) method is introduced to them, they sometimes have to unlearn what they&#8217;ve known to be the right way. I experienced this the first time I installed iTunes (version 1). &#8220;You mean it actually manages the song files for me using the ID3 information?!&#8221; I thought. Yes. And FontExplorer does the same, only with fonts. Imagine that.</p>

The key for me was allowing FE to manage my files by <em>moving</em> them. It felt a bit like letting go of the reins, but once I did it, my 1000+ font collection became much more manageable.</p>
