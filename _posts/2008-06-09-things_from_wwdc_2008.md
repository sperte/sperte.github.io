<ul>
<li>iPhone 2.0 supports multiple calendars</li>
<li>The 8GB iPod Touch is now $100 more than the 8GB iPhone 3G</li>
<li>The white variant of the iPhone 3G is only available in the 16GB model</li>
<li>&#8220;Enterprise&#8221; is, apparently, what Apple calls &#8220;business&#8221;</li>
<li>MobileMe&#8217;s iDisk is very robust, allowing for publicly sharing files openly, with a password, limited to number of downloads or set a time limit</li>
<li>Apple isn&#8217;t, as promised in March, going to deliver the iPhone 2.0 software update by the end of June </li>
