<p>I just read <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">an article</a> that is sure to change the way I approach design &#8230; in a good way. I&#8217;ve always respected <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com" title="Cameron Moll">Cameron Moll</a>, the author of the article. He&#8217;s a well-respected designer, but he&#8217;s also a great guy and <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000279.html">dad</a>. He&#8217;s also a good friend of a <a href="http://www.31three.com">good friend</a>.</p>

<p>The article changed the way I think about design aesthetic and purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
