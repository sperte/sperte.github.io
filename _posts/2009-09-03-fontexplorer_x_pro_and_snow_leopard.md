<p><strong>Update:</strong> Monotype Imaging has <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/fontexplorer_x_pro_updated_to_work_with_snow_leopard/">updated FontExplorer X Pro</a> to work with Snow Leopard now.</p>

<p>There are some incompatibilities with the current release of <a href="http://www.fontexplorerx.com/">FontExplorer X Pro</a> and Snow Leopard. I wish I had time to research and accurately document all of them; I don&#8217;t. However, I know of at least two reproducible ones:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The &#8220;Clean System Font Folders&#8221; function attempts to disable protected fonts (<a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/3609273528">as previously reported</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Fonts activated by FontExplorer X Pro which are not located in one of the default system font folders will not be available to the system-wide Fonts panel after a restart or re-login</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A simple workaround for the second item is to launch FontExplorer X Pro, deactivate, then reactivate the fonts you want to be available to the Fonts panel.</p>

<p>I emailed Linotype about these issues and received a reply promising a new version of FontExplorer X Pro soon. To the question about whether or not the above workaround is the best way to &#8216;get by&#8217; right now, they said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our development department is trying to solve all compatibility issues as soon as possible and update a new version of FontExplorer X Pro. Please use this workaround until we fix this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No release date or additional details about the update were given. So, I guess we just wait.</p>
