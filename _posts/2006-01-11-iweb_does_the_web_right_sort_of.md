<p>Well if <a href="http://www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog.html">this</a> is any indication of what we can expect from the Apple-designed templates in iWeb, I guess we&#8217;re not so bad off. The .Mac blog <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog.html">doesn&#8217;t validate</a> because of a non-existant (in XHTML 1.0) parameter in their JavaScript (&#8220;onload&#8221;), <strong>but it comes close</strong>. <del>All</del> <ins>Most</ins> of the CSS is inline, and looks like it gets optimized before it&#8217;s uploaded &#8211; how <em>well</em> it&#8217;s optimized is the question. The <a href="http://www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog_files/Blog.css">generated external stylesheet</a> could definitely benefit from shorthand.</p>
