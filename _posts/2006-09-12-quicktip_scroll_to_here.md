<p>Here&#8217;s a nice little feature I didn&#8217;t know existed in OS X: Option-click in an empty scroll bar area to scroll-to-here rather than scroll page-by-page. (The behavior has been a preference in the System Preferences for some time, but I didn&#8217;t know you could use the alternate method on the fly.)</p>

<p>Incidentally, this feature also works with the &#8220;coverflow&#8221; view in iTunes (which is how I discovered it). Very cool!</p>
