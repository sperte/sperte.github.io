<p>All this attention put into so-called usability and OS developers still aren&#8217;t taking advantage of depth of field. Why not, instead of changing colors, borders, and shadows, use a blur technique for inactive windows? It&#8217;s already built into Mac OS (ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Image" title="Core Image definition in Wikipedia">Core Image</a>) so why not utilize it? I&#8217;m not a developer, so maybe I&#8217;m missing something.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have to be much. In the example above I used a value of 0.5 (of Photoshop&#8217;s &#8220;Gaussian Blur&#8221; effect) &#8211; and it&#8217;s almost too much. The effect is visually appealing as eye-candy, yes, but is also useful in determining focus more immediately. Of course, it could even be provided as a user preference, allowing for greater or lesser blur for inactive windows. It could even be applied to the desktop and its icons.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re on the subject of the desktop, another question: Why not allow for a user to evoke Expos√©&#8217;s &#8220;Desktop&#8221; state when clicking on [an unoccupied spot on] the desktop? (App idea?)</p>
