<p>The way I see it, I should credit the original author or creator of a work, without question. However, I&#8217;m <a href="http://chuckskoda.com/entry/my-via-code-of-conduct/">not going to stress</a> over giving credit (e.g. &#8220;via so-and-so&#8221;) to the person or website that relays the link to the work to me via RSS, tweet, email or otherwise. If I can &#8211; meaning the tools are there for me to automatically do so &#8211; I will. Otherwise, I&#8217;m not going to go out of my way to credit someone for merely passing on a link. (It&#8217;s the internet, after all. It&#8217;s made of links.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying posting a link to something isn&#8217;t worthy of some appreciation. That&#8217;s different. I will do my best to thank those that link to something I take an interest in, and/or pass on to my followers and readers. And, where possible, I&#8217;ll do so using the same medium. For example, if I follow a link in a tweet that I find interesting, I&#8217;ll reply using Twitter.</p>

<p>In other words, you don&#8217;t always have to reward the messenger, just thank them.</p>
