I&#8217;ll [hopefully] have a more detailed review later, but I can&#8217;t help but post a few initial thoughts. Keep in mind I&#8217;ve already had a month to play with friends&#8217; iPhones.</p>

<ol>
<li>The AT&amp;T sales rep said of the 490+ iPhones they&#8217;ve sold, only three had been returned &#8211; two for replacements, one because the owner couldn&#8217;t leave Verizon without breaking his contract.</li>
<li>My absolute favorite feature so far is the iPod muting when a call comes in.</li>
<li>If it wasn&#8217;t already clear to me, now I absolutely understand how 1.0 this software is &#8211; there&#8217;s no chance of listening to the iPod while surfing MobileSafari until a software update comes. </li>
