<p>As if I needed a clearer picture of how busy my life is at the moment: The Wife&trade; and I returned home tonight from a church prayer meeting and (finally) checked our mailbox. (You know, the postal service one &#8230; by the side of the road &#8230; <em>non</em>-electronic.) It&#8217;s probably been a month since we last got the mail.</p>

<p>On top of the half-foot stack of mail was a friendly notice saying our mailbox was too full, and that all mail would be held (as of 3/22) at the local branch office for ten days; and after that, returned to sender. Yikes! Ten days from the notice is, uhm, <em>today</em>!</p>

<p>You want to know the irony of it all? The entire stack of mail we pulled tonight was, as you may have guessed, ALL JUNK MAIL.</p>

<p>So, not only was I reminded how busy we really are, but also how much I hate regular mail. The real question now is, do we actually <em>care</em> if all our mail is returned?</p>
