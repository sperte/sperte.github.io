<p><img src="/assets/img/googlesean.jpg" border="0" height="65" width="122" alt="Google page 9" align="right" />I&#8217;m pretty proud. My &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/technology/" title="PageRank as explained by Google">PageRank</a>&#8221; is a 6/10, apparently, but better than that: If you search Google for &#8220;Sean&#8221;, my site comes up on page 9.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
