That&#8217;s basically all you&#8217;re giving up by getting the 8GB black iPod nano (still a lowercase &#8216;N&#8217;, by the way). Well, there&#8217;s that and the video playback. And the games. And the bigger screen.</p>

<p>But besides that, you&#8217;re getting the same great music player. Right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll end my sarcasm for a moment; just long enough to point out that as of last Tuesday, you&#8217;ll pay the same price for a 30GB video iPod as you will for a nano with less than half the storage, no video functionality, smaller screen, and no color options.</p>

<p>Apparently they think we&#8217;re dumb, blinded consumer folk who will gladly give up all that for a fancy, anodized-aluminum, thinner-than-a-pencil, as-small-as-a-business-card case. Sure.</p>

<p>(Oh, man, I want one so bad.)</p>
