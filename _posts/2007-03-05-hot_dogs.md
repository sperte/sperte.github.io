<p>While deciding on a place to eat lunch, The Wife suggested (in all seriousness) a hot dog vendor located in the middle of <a href="http://www.redmondtowncenter.com/">Redmond Town Center</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;The only time I eat hot dogs is during a sporting event.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could run around RTC,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Rolling my eyes, I replied, &#8220;no, I mean, a sporting event in which I am a spectator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> could run around it and you could watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>We decided on something else.</p>
