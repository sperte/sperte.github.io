<p>Today I <a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/6772570127">posted a screenshot</a> of my menubar via Twitter, noting how ridiculous I thought it was getting. Grant Blakeman said it best in <a href="http://twitter.com/gblakeman/status/6773054680">his reply</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the top-right of the osx menu is the bastard step-child of window&#8217;s task-bar. i often won&#8217;t use a program if there is no hide option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also noted in a followup response that developers have gotten into a bad habit of assuming their app deserves (or requires) ubiquitous accessibility. I agree.</p>

<p>Later, I audited my menubar and revised it:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/menubar.jpg" alt="My menubar"  /></p>

<p>From left to right: <a href="http://droplr.com">Droplr</a>, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, VPN (built-in), Battery status, Wi-Fi, date and clock, Accounts (built-in), and Spotlight.</p>

<p>(Worth noting: this is my work computer. My personal laptop doesn&#8217;t include the VPN or Accounts icons.)</p>

<p>I removed the <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> icon because, while I like the subtle notifications it provides, there&#8217;s no (supported) way to remove the Dock icon, so the menubar icon was repetitive.</p>

<p>I removed the <a href="http://tapbots.com/pastebot/#sync">Pastebot Sync</a> icon because, well, it&#8217;s not really necessary. In my real-world tests, Pastebot has worked flawlessly, without the need for access to the Preference Pane.</p>

<p>I quit <a href="http://www.expandrive.com/mac">ExpanDrive</a> and removed it from Login Items because I haven&#8217;t been using it lately. If and when I need it, I can launch the app.</p>

<p>I removed the MobileMe Sync icon because I rarely need to manually initialize a synchronization operation.</p>

<p>I removed the Sound icon because I have access to audio controls on my keyboard.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I got quite a few replies with screenshots to my tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3Yz5B">Chris Merritt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3Zq2v">Matt Heerema</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3ZB76">Jesse J. Anderson</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3ZWdi">Brian Warren</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/4034U">Sean Gaffney</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And I thought <em>my</em> menubar was bad.</p>
