<p><img src="/assets/img/itunes7icon.jpg" border="0" height="80" width="66" alt="itunes7icon.jpg" align="" align="right" />I just have one question regarding today&#8217;s announcements from Apple. What&#8217;s up with the iTunes 7 icon? What, did they use TimeMachine to snag iTunes 2&#8217;s icon?</p>
