title: Well begun
---
There are probably dozens of scientific studies that show &#8230; dang, what am I even talking about? I have no idea how to write. I&#8217;m not a journalism or English major. I&#8217;m probably breaking rules already, just with this opening paragraph.

Anyway, what I&#8217;m trying to say is that I assume most of the science of being productive has to do with just getting started. The whole &#8220;get off the couch&#8221; thing, or &#8220;well begun is half done&#8221;, as Mary Poppins would say. Like a train leaving the station, in order for us to get anywhere, we&#8217;ve got to put a lot of effort towards that first step: from Stop to Go.

This is one of the reasons that, as a designer/developer, I need to pay close attention into the amount of friction I put into the products I build. People already have a hard enough time learning new things. I should aim to make it as effortless as possible to &#8220;engage&#8221;.

It&#8217;s also the reason I&#8217;m clumsily trudging back into the world of blogging &#8211; or whatever you call this; publishing random thoughts to the web. I have no clear objective, haven&#8217;t written or sketched out a game plan, don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m writing for, and obviously am not qualified. I&#8217;ve just &#8230; begun. Again.

It&#8217;s the first day of the New Year &#8211; well, it&#8217;s the evening of the first day. Whatever endeavor awaits your (whoever you are) involvement, my challenge to you is just do it.
