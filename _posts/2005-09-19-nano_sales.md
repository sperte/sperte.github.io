<p>Despite what <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10793_3-5870633.html?part=rss&tag=5870633&subj=news">the media are reporting</a> I assure you, iPod nano sales are going well. I know this because I was unable to get one until a full 10 days after they were announced and made available. I had been actively (read: &#8220;multiple times per day&#8221;) calling every Apple Store and electronics store in the area asking if they had the 4GB model in stock. I was on several &#8220;call lists&#8221; and also noticed the ship delay go from 2-3 days to 5-7 days on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/store">Apple website</a>.</p>

<p>I actually noticed this discrepancy in the news last week; some reported sales as going well, some as not-so-good. I even commented to a friend about it. The bottom line (to consumers) is that the nano is selling, and selling fast. If you want one (and who doesn&#8217;t?), then you&#8217;ve got to be fast and furious.</p>
