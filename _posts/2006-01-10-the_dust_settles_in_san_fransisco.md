<p>Today the Mac community simultaneously let out the breath they&#8217;ve been holding; and after the dust settled a new Intel-iMac and Intel-<del>PowerBook</del> <ins>MacBook</ins> were revealed.</p>

<p>Boasting speeds up to <strong>5 times faster</strong> than their predecessors, the new systems from Apple are available for order today (the laptop will ship in February). As of this writing the Apple Online Store is still down, but should reflect the new models and pricing by the time you read.</p>

<p>More of my thoughts later.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Apple&#8217;s posted the product page for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/intel/">Intel Macs page</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: I&#8217;d just like to point out the new <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a> homepage and Intel <del>PowerBooks</del> <ins>MacBook Pros</ins> &#8230; ahem, &#8220;<a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/geekandmild/entry/predictions_version_2006/">nailed it</a>&#8221;!</p>
