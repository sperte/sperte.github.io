<p>I can&#8217;t decide between a brand new iPod nano, or a (since discountinued) 30GB iPod photo. You all know why I&#8217;d spring for the nano, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve raised an eyebrow about the 30GB photo. Here are my reasons to go with the older, larger model:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can fit ALL my music and ALL my photos (which results in a reliable backup solution)</li>
<li>More accessory options</li>
</ul>

<p>The nano <em>is</em> capable of storing and viewing photos, but I have over 5GB of photos. I don&#8217;t know how I got that many, but I do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already tried to get a nano twice &#8230; both times I&#8217;ve showed up at the store (different vendors, mind you) and been told they had literally <em>just</em> sold out. This after I called and confirmed its availablity at both places. Oh, the humanity! Now, I&#8217;m starting to wonder if God is trying to tell me something. Maybe I should just give up and go with the more innocuus, 30GB model.</p>

<p>Hence, my iPod dilemma.</p>
