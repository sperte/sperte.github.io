<p>The internet is awesome. Actually, no. The <em>people</em> of the internet are awesome. The reason I know this is because last week I attended two conferences where I got to be with a lot of them. Some I&#8217;d just met, but some I&#8217;d been following for years &#8211; even a decade or more. 
That term: following. I used it a lot over the last six days. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been following you for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said it to <a href="http://shauninman.com/">Shaun Inman</a>, <a href="http://mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron Moll</a>, <a href="http://tincorporated.com/">Tom Watson</a> (well, his wife, actually), <a href="http://drewwarkentin.com/">Drew Warkentin</a>, <a href="http://shop.ugmonk.com/">Jeff Sheldon</a>, <a href="http://www.brandclay.com/">Sean Ferrell</a>, <a href="http://paularmstrong.me/">Paul Armstrong</a>, and many others. What I realized is that I&#8217;d been &#8220;following&#8221; these people long before Twitter, so the statement sounded trite and didn&#8217;t communicate the level of respect I have them. What I wanted to tell them, actually, was that their work had inspired and mentored me from afar.</p>

<p>Circles Conference was held in Dallas and organized by <a href="http://burciaga.co/">Ismael Burciaga</a>. Its emphasis was on creativity, design, and art &#8211; and, ultimately, the inspiration of all those things. The talks themselves were great, and I enjoyed hearing from every speaker. But I was more inspired by meeting and speaking with the people who made up the conference. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tiffapiffa">Tiffany Duening</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRocco">Andy Rossi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sawyermaigen">Maigan Sawyer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanhartsock">Ryan Hartsock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdavidgfx">Chris David G</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alextheduck27">Alex Grigas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/HouseofGrays">Megan Gray</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/evies">Evie Shaffer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/daveonkels">Dave Onkels</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Just click through some of those profiles, Dribbble accounts, blogs, etc. You can&#8217;t help but be inspired.</p>

<p>The same was true of XOXO &#8211; which I sort of see as a gathering of artists and inventors (a gross over generalization, I know). The &#8220;d-word&#8221; (disruption) was used sparingly, but the <em>idea</em> permeated almost every talk and discussion. To what end? Not surprisingly, almost every talk touched on the idea of community &#8211; people coming together.</p>

<p>Some of the wonderful people I met at XOXO:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wanderingmatt">Matthew Anderson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/atnan">Nathan de Vries</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/yarrcat">Ros Hodgekiss</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris Messina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brynn">Brynn Evans</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tempo">Thor</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyGSFN">Amy Muller</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sonaar">Sonaar Luthra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikerugnetta">Mike Rugnetta</a> (why this guy doesn&#8217;t have more followers is crazy to me)</li>
<li>and many others&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for me, if I had any takeaways from the two conferences, they almost certainly all collide in the intersection between community, creativity, disruption, and people &#8211; particularly the people who make the internet.</p>

<p>People are awesome. That&#8217;s my big revelation from this past week. No duh, right?</p>
