<p><img src="/assets/img/nintendo-revolution.jpg" alt="Nintendo Revolution" class="imgright" /><a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse</a> tells me that the yet-to-be-released Nintendo Revolution will <a href="http://www.revolutionfanboy.com/2006/03/23/virtual-console-sega-and-hudson-games-are-a-go/">play Sega Genesis games</a>. Cool. &#8220;Wise from your gwraves!&#8221; (Com&#8217;on, don&#8217;t tell me you never played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Beast">Altered Beast</a>.)</p>

<p class="update" style="clear: both;">So I guess it&#8217;s not the &#8220;revolution&#8221; anymore. Whatever. More interesting to me is the DS Lite, hitting stores June 11th for a mere $129.</p>
