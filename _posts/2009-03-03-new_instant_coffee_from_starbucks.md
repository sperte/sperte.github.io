<p>For the past two weeks here in Seattle, Starbucks stores have been passing out sample packs of <a href="http://starbucks.com/via">VIA</a>, their new instant coffee. I tried my first cup last week and <a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/1259172314">tweeted my thoughts</a>: it was surprisingly good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seansperte/3326599252/" title="VIA by Sean Sperte, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3584/3326599252_afd3bf8b70.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="VIA"  /></a></p>

<p>VIA <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008804732_viaside03.html">started as an idea 20 years ago</a> and is now a retail reality; a very good tasting reality. As I type this I&#8217;m enjoying a cup of the Italian Roast with a bit of International Delight vanilla creamer. It&#8217;s <em>almost</em> as good as french press.</p>
