<p>I&#8217;ve had it with my RSS feeds. Some are broken, some are too active, some are dumb and others are barely ever updated (<em>nudge</em> Jesse <em>nudge</em>); all are unorganized.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m rebuilding, starting from scratch. Yes, I&#8217;ve actually deleted my entire feed list and am now completely void of updated content! Blogs, articles, news, views, etc. I ain&#8217;t got none! I feel naked, stripped of my dignity and disconnected from society. (Okay, it&#8217;s not that bad.)</p>

<p>What I need from you guys, are suggestions for who/what to add to my new feed list. I like blogs on (web) design, culture, technology, and emerging church leadership &#8211; whatever that is.</p>

<p>Help!</p>
