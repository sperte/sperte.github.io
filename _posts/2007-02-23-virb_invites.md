<p>Okay <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/show_me_the_virb_knock">my contest</a> didn&#8217;t work out so well. Either a) no one&#8217;s interested in Virb.com, or b) I haven&#8217;t the readership to support a contest to give out invitations to it. The latter I can deal with, and completely understand. The hype surrounding Virb is such, though, that I would think anyone who&#8217;s at all interested in social networking, Web 2.0, independent music, new media or any other buzz word, would be interested in seeing Virb for themselves.</p>

<p>I can only conclude, then, that the cost is perceived as too great. Well, let me fix that: <strong>Want an invite to Virb? Just ask.</strong></p>

<p class="update"><strong>Update:</strong> Still have a bunch of invites, but I&#8217;m going to begin giving them away to people I know off the internets. Now or never, people!</p>

<p class="update"><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://www.virb.com">She lives!</a> VIRB is now open to the public, so go signup, add me as a friend, and commit <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70717-0.html">myspacecide</a>.</p>
