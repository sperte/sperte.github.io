Factor in the occasional toffee almond bar, and I&#8217;m spending an average of $5 every time I have a coffee craving in the middle of the day. What&#8217;s worse, lately, since we&#8217;ve run out of coffee for my barista machine at home<sup>1</sup>, I&#8217;ve been visiting the big SB in the mornings as well.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s with an aching wallet and bruised checking account that I whipped up this desktop picture &#8211; designed to sit as a reminder that, yes, gasoline for your body costs more than gasoline for your car.</p>

<p>At the risk of lawsuit and/or not-friendliness from the coffee corp itself, I now offer it to you, the world. Why? Because I care.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
