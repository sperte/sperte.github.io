<p>I&#8217;m in the market to buy an iPod (as a gift) so I started to get frustrated when reports came in today that local Apple Stores hadn&#8217;t dropped prices on iPods &#8230; then I realized there&#8217;s no incentive for Apple to do so. Think about it, every day is &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; for Apple (the &#8220;black&#8221; being derived from the sales numbers being in the black, as opposed to the red). Oh well.</p>
