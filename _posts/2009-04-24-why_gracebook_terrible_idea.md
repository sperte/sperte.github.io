<p>Let me explain something. The reason something like a &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/1530405887">Gracebook</a>&#8221; will never get my support &#8211; and the reason I sarcastically remarked about it &#8211; is because it&#8217;s a regurgitated idea.</p>

<p>So, just so we&#8217;re clear, here are some guidelines for creating a social network:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t create a network/service for a single demographic.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t charge money.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t name it anything stupid.</li>
</ol>

<p>We clear?</p>
