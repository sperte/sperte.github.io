<p>I&#8217;ve got a problem. I&#8217;ve finally figured out how to mount a home directory on a file server at work &#8211; it&#8217;s a bit of a hack, but it works. In other words, my entire &#8220;home&#8221; directory is actually my user folder on the network, and the Mac mounts it as home. My Library, preferences, documents, music, photos, etc. are all stored and accessed on the network. It works great &#8230; except for FontExplorer, which seems to think it&#8217;s being launched for the first time, <em>every</em> time. It keeps wanting to go through the initial setup process.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s still beta, but why can&#8217;t it just work like every other program seems to?</p>

<p>Any help/advice/suggestions would be appreciated. I&#8217;m stuck.</p>
