<p>After a day of nano ownership, here&#8217;s (the first of) my inevitable review(s).</p>

The pluses:

<ul>
<li>Amazing screen &#8211; it literally looks like paper, and works well in direct sunlight</li>
<li>USB 2.0 is super-fast; noticeable faster than FireWire, for some reason</li>
<li>Menu access is faster than previous models</li>
<li>Sound-quality is great</li>
</ul>

<p>The minuses (mostly with iTunes):</p>

<ul>
<li>Can&#8217;t leave the nano in the source list (as you can with the shuffle)</li>
<li>When using the Manually Update option, you must manually update songs you&#8217;ve changed (e.g. by adding album art), which means you can easily create duplicates</li>
<li>Similarly, &#8220;Show duplicate songs&#8221; isn&#8217;t supported within the iPod songlist</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a magnet for fingerprints and scratches (com&#8217;on Apple, get those cases shipping!)</li>
</ul>
