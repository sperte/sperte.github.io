<p>I stopped by my local Mac Store today &#8211; no, not the Apple Store, the <a href="http://www.thecomputerstore.com ">Mac Store</a>. I almost wish I wouldn&#8217;t have. 
While browsing the myriad of iPod accessories they had displayed I overheard a gentleman ask one of the employees if they had any MacBook&#8217;s in stock. The female employee, who I could tell was fond of herself talking, replied by giving a long, innacurate summary of the MacBook Pro and what it is; finally answering that they did indeed have one in stock, in the back. This is where my interest was piqued and I stopped pretending not to hear &#8211; I turned and looked at the employee dead-on.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not allowed to put it out until Apple does,&#8221; she said, I guess implying that they have to wait for the Apple Store to put it out first &#8230; ? I rolled my eyes and went back to browsing. I could tell her knowledge went about as deep as the Finder help menu.</p>

<p>&#8220;So can I see it now?&#8221; the customer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks just like the previous PowerBook,&#8221; another (male) employee joined the conversation. &#8220;But they just have the 15-inch version right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise, it&#8217;s the exact same,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It feels the same, looks the same &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, besides the iSight!&#8221; laughed the female employee.</p>

<p>I guess you had to be there, but at this point I realized these employees were, in fact, idiots. I felt really sorry for the guy who asked the question. They obviously didn&#8217;t have a MacBook and just wanted to &#8220;sell&#8221; the guy on one.</p>

<p>Anyway, they went on to tell the gentleman that they did, in fact, have a 17&#8221; Intel-iMac on the show-floor that he could look at. They pointed it out, and after a few minutes of playing around on it, the guy went about his way. I hoped on and double-checked to make sure it was an Intel machine. It was!</p>

<p>All I have to say is, <em>Intel shmintel</em>. The &#8220;noticable&#8221; speed difference wasn&#8217;t there. I don&#8217;t know what <a href="http://macbreak.com/">Leo and Amber</a> were testing at MacWorld when they reported such amazing performance &#8211; it certainly wasn&#8217;t the same model I was on. Then again, having recently upgraded to a dual-core G5 machine I&#8217;ve probably become a little spoiled.</p>

<p>Okay, I admit, I&#8217;ve <em>definitely</em> become a little spoiled.</p>

<p>Still, I was expecting more &#8211; you know, because of all the &#8220;4x faster&#8221; hype Apple has been pushing. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait for the &#8220;real world&#8221; benchmarks, and the MacBook Pro&#8217;s release, to see if this Intel business is what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.</p>
