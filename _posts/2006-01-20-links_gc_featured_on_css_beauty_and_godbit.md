<p>The new Generation Church site has been featured on <a href="http://cssbeauty.com/archives/2006/January/generation_church/">CSS Beauty</a> and <a href="http://godbit.com/featured/generation-church">Godbit</a>! Woohoo! (I have mixed emotions about this since the site is nowhere near complete, but this is what I get for releasing a public beta.)</p>
