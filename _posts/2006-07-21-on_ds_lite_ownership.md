<p>It&#8217;s been about 6 weeks since I ditched <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/psp/">my PSP</a> and got myself a real game-playing portable device: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ds_lite">The Nintendo DS Lite</a>. How has it held up to my expectations as an admitted non-gamer, gadget-saavy, tech-head? Unbelievably. 
I can&#8217;t stop raving about this thing. From the form factor, to the fun and exciting gameplay, to the incredible ease-of-use, to the awesome feature set (with an almost over-the-counter feel), <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;m quite convinced the DS Lite is a must-have for anyone</span>. I&#8217;m talking to you. Yes, you. You&#8217;re anyone, right? Go now, do yourself a favor, and pick up a DS Lite.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my good friend Matt is. He was a hard-core PSP owner, with tons of games. Shortly after I picked up my DS Lite and showed it off a bit, he sold his PSP and games (plus a UMD movie), and hasn&#8217;t looked back. This is the guy who convinced me to get a PSP and was against me selling it when I did.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my grandma is. She picked up her DS Lite about three weeks ago (by my advice) and now has at least 4 games and some accessories. She just emailed me to ask when I&#8217;d be over to meet her new puppy &#8211; apparently she got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my wife is. She actually hasn&#8217;t picked one up yet because we&#8217;re waiting for the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/27/pink-is-the-new-ds-lite/">pink version</a> &#8211; but she asks to play mine all the time. She loves it.</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? Okay, lightning round:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only $130 retail</li>
<li>Games are $35 (when they&#8217;re brand-new)</li>
<li>It supports GameBoy Advanced games</li>
<li>WiFi gameplay supports games against other DS owners with OR without the particular game you have, AND online gaming against people all over the world</li>
<li>Speakers are incredible, with surround-sound like sound</li>

<li>An easy-to-use system menu with clock, calendar, alarm clock and chatting application</li>
<li>Potential to surf the web (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbSq-tCHXmI">Opera is developing a cool web browser</a>)</li>
<li>Will play (nice) with the up-and-coming Wii console system</li>
<li>Practically zero load times</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q="ds+lite"+accessories&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Accessories galore</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-second-look.html">Cool video reviews</a> (never saw those for the PSP, didja?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So &#8230; convinced <em>yet</em>? Of course you are. You&#8217;re not even reading this, you&#8217;re on your way to Target or GameSpot to pick one up now, right?</p>

<p><del>See</del> <ins>Play</ins> ya online. (Don&#8217;t forget to practice your <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/snaked/">snaking</a>.)</p>
