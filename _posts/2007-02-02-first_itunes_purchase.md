<p>Did you know you can view your entire Purchase History from the iTunes Store? While browsing mine I found my first-ever purchase. Turns out it was Clocks by Coldplay, a full 4 years ago!</p>

<p>So what was yours? To find out, go to the iTunes Store and <a href="itms://phobos.apple.com/accountSummary">your account settings</a>. From there you just hit the &#8220;Purchase History&#8221; button and jump to the very start of your history. Post your results here (if you&#8217;re brave enough)!</p>
