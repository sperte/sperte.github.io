<p>Tweaking this site has uncovered a slight rendering issue with Safari. It shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal, but it&#8217;s driving me crazy. I&#8217;m searching for answers. 
I know I shouldn&#8217;t be as bothered by this as I am, but I just cannot seem to let it go. I&#8217;ve scoured the web for a solution and no one seems to even recognize it as an issue.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: I&#8217;ve got a single background image (for <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) set to be center-aligned and repeat vertically. Then, I&#8217;ve got a div container set at 400px wide, centered. Here&#8217;s the basic CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body &#123;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: 'lucida grande','trebuchet ms',sans-serif;
    background: #fff url(/images/bg_fullbody2.gif) top center repeat-y;
    &#125;
#container &#123;
    width: 460px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    position: relative;
    border: 0;
    &#125;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1px_shift.gif" width="90" height="90" alt="Screenshot showing the 1-pixel shift rendered by Safari" align="right" />Safari, for some reason God only knows, shifts the container div 1px to the left. I&#8217;m left with three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Somehow target only Safari and use <code>left: 1px</code>, which I cannot seem to figure a way to do</li>
<li>Change the design</li>
<li>Live with it (please note that this is hardly an option, it just seemed better to list three)</li>
</ol>

<p>So, being that I have no time for option number two, and option three is out of the question, is there an answer for number one?</p>
