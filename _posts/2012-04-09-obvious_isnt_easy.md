<p>A <a href="http://om.co/2012/04/05/the-of-course-principle-of-design/">lot</a> of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/04/obviousness">talk</a> about <a href="http://dewith.com/2012/simplicity-and-obviousness/">designing for obviousness</a> in the design community lately. I just have one observation beyond agreement. Designing for obviousness is hard because you have to account for existing user conventions despite their weaknesses. That means good, obvious design has to take into account all three tenses: past, present, and future.</p>
