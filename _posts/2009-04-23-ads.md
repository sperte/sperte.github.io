<p><img src="/assets/img/fusionads.jpg" alt="Fusion Ads" border="0" width="200" height="200" class="imgright" />If you visit my website you&#8217;ll notice a new feature: <a href="http://fusionads.net">Fusion Ads</a>. I debated accepting the invitation from the Fusion Ad Network for a long time &#8211; mostly because I&#8217;m not a big fan of web ads. What finally convinced me was my own interest in the ads as I saw them appear on all my favorite blogs (and now even software).</p>

<p>When I realized how compelling the ads were to me, and how many products and services advertised I actually used or owned, I figured they would be beneficial for readers of Geek &amp; Mild. And since I can&#8217;t always feature great software or services in posts or links, the ads will help augment that limitation.</p>
