<p>I&#8217;m a caterer. Some of the people I make food for are sitting at a lopsided table &#8211; which makes for an unpleasant eating experience, no matter where they get their food.</p>

<p>The question is this: Is it worth it for me to create a customized menu, equipped with plates and utensils that compensate for the table&#8217;s lopsidedness, for this segment of eaters?</p>

<p>I say no.</p>
