<p>Here&#8217;s my draft results from last night. I play in an <abbr title="Independent Defensive Players">IDP</abbr> league with two starting QB&#8217;s (read: deep), and had the third pick. I had a couple of really dumb selections, but overall I&#8217;m satisfied with my team &#8211; especially considering our league&#8217;s unique scoring and roster settings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Peyton Manning (3)</li>
<li>Tony Romo (18)</li>
<li>Laurence Maroney (23)</li>
<li>TJ Housh (38)</li>
<li>Marion Barber (43)</li>
<li>Santonio Holmes (58)</li>
<li>Alex Smith (63)</li>
<li>DJ Hackett (78)</li>
<li>Charles Woodson (83)</li>
<li>Ray Lewis (98)</li>
<li>Devin Hester (103)</li>
<li>Adalius Thomas (118)</li>
<li>Dre&#8217; Bly (123)</li>
<li>Michael Turner (138)</li>
<li>Najeh Davenport (143)</li>
<li>Isaac Bruce (158)</li>
<li>DeAngelo Hall (163)</li>
<li>Damon Huard (178)</li>
<li>Heath Miller (183)</li>
<li>Shaun Phillips (198)</li>
<li>Bart Scott (203)</li>
<li>Matt Stover (218)</li>
</ol>

<p>My 8th round pick is <em>obviously</em> a reach, but I&#8217;ve got a good feeling about DJ this year. I also got a lot of flack for the Santonio Holmes and Charles Woodson picks. Whatever. All the guys had their noses in their dated fantasy magazines while I was busy looking up live and accurate-to-our-league stats on my laptop. One guy (and I won&#8217;t name names) even drafted Corey Dillon (retired), Jared Allen (suspended), and Darrent Williams (dead).</p>

<p>The pick I regret most is the 15th round, Najeh Davenport. In fact, I&#8217;ve already dropped him in favor of Antwaan Randle El.</p>

<p>And I know your asking yourself, &#8220;why&#8217;d he draft 4 QB&#8217;s?&#8221; Good question. Let&#8217;s just say, it was intentional.~</p>
