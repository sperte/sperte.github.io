<p>Welcome to the new <span>seansperte.com</span>. By now you&#8217;ve been duly disappointed by the lack of content and/or underwhelming design representation. You may feel like Dorothy having just uncovered the <a href="http://www.newyorkslime.com/wizard-behind-curtain.jpg">man behind the curtain</a>. For that I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s never my intention to deliver unfinished works, and this website is the epitome of unfinished.</p>

<p>While finished I&#8217;m not, started I am. And I&#8217;m not just talking like Yoda here, I&#8217;m thinking like him, too: &#8220;Do or do not, there is no try.&#8221; After all, it&#8217;s only been, what, 10 years since I had a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991003055951/http://members.xoom.com/sperte/">personal website</a> worthy of a visit? (We&#8217;re purposefully not counting <a href="http://www.commentsense.com">CommentSense</a> here.) I just figured I might as well <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558504796/103-6105700-0007836?v=glance">just do it</a>.</p>

<p>So here it is.</p>
