<p>I&#8217;ve made some minor changes to Geek &amp; Mild, as you&#8217;ll notice:</p>

<ul>
<li>New masthead (hoorah)</li>
<li>Clickable feed link on homepage - I&#8217;ve always had a feed available, but just via the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
<li>Ability to comment and link to Link entries</li>
<li>Denoted Link entries (the green &#8220;link&#8221; icon)</li>
<li>Some minor code/system enhancements</li>
<li>Fixed some comment bugs/quirks that supressed Textile&#8217;s HTML conversions (that&#8217;s for you, Simon)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still want to implement live preview for comments and upgrade to ExpressionEngine 1.4. I&#8217;m also developing an actual top-level navigation (you know, like a &#8220;real&#8221; website would have?) for about and archive pages. And, of course, I definitely want to add some kickin&#8217; AJAX stuff &#8230; All that in the future.</p>

<p>Anything else I need to do, like, ASAP?</p>
