<p>According to Computer World we&#8217;re supposed to <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9010521&pageNumber=1" title="Eight reasons to think twice about buying an iPhone">think twice about buying an iPhone</a>. They&#8217;ve provided eight reasons, some of which are good thoughts &#8211; but there&#8217;s a lot of misinformation, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the big criticisms of the iPhone is that it will only support 2G data service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it supports 2.5G (EDGE) data and <em>automatically</em> switches to WiFi were available. I guess it&#8217;s just me, but I find open wireless networks just about everywhere I go now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider how cramped that space will be if you want to store and watch video on your iPhone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, consider that, because you can&#8217;t fit nearly as much as you can on your laptop, HDTV or DVD shelving. Com&#8217;on, guys, it&#8217;s a <em>phone</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] if you typically opt for an entry-level or more basic phone, you may find that you won&#8217;t use all of those features</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This under the warning for if you&#8217;re an &#8220;entry-level&#8221; user. First of all, they&#8217;ve obviously forgotten their audience. Secondly, I&#8217;d like to see an &#8220;entry-level phone user&#8221; pick up an iPhone and start to use it compared to picking up, say, a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&ver=4001&template=pp1_1_1&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10393" title="Sony Ericsson J110">Sony Ericsson J110</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you need more features or applications on your phone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230; then the iPhone isn&#8217;t designed for you anyway, weirdo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While many smart phones can interact with Exchange servers, the iPhone cannot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Flat-out wrong. Sure they go on to mention the iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;basic POP/IMAP mail access&#8221; on Exchange Servers, but with a statement like that they&#8217;re purposefully misleading people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone announced last month isn&#8217;t likely to be the only iPhone that Apple will produce. It seems almost certain, based on statements from both Cingular and Apple, that future iPhone models will be released [&#8230;]
  If you feel that this first iPhone is too expensive, too limited or just isn&#8217;t for you, keep in mind that over the next year or two, there may be a model that will be more appealing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, good point. If you&#8217;re not an early adopter you may want to sit this one out.</p>
