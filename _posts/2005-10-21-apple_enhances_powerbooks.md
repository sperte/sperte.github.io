<p>Interesting word choice Apple is using for their HotNews article about the new PowerBooks. No upgrade, update or &#8220;new.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/enhanced_powerbooks.jpg" width="256" height="92" alt=""  /></p>

<p>I got a chance to play with an &#8220;enhanced&#8221; 15-inch PowerBook today and I must say it was nice. The extra pixels really do make a difference, and the trackpad (though not officially updated) felt a lot nicer and tracked better than mine &#8211; I have the 1.67ghz model, introduced earlier this year.</p>

<p>In my extremely professional lab test (turning off the lights and placing the two laptops next to each other), I concluded that the so-called increased brightness isn&#8217;t real-world evident. Meaning I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>

<p>But whatever. It&#8217;s probably the last &#8220;enhancement&#8221; this line will see, as most of the world is anxiously awaiting the dual-core or Intel PowerBooks.</p>
