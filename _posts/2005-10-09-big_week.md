<p>I&#8217;m anticipating a big week. Sony Ericsson will probably unveil some new phones (I&#8217;m holding out for the &#8220;Sakura&#8221;) and Apple has something up their sleeve for Wednesday. I&#8217;ve sold my Treo (unsure of the future of Palm OS, not to mention the entire company), so I&#8217;ve got a nice chunk of cash with which to get myself a new phone. The Wife&trade; continues to be amazed how I come up with the money needed to support my gadget fetish.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
