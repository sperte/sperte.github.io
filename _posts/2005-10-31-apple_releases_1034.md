<p>Apple [finally] released the OS 10.4.3 update we&#8217;ve all been so patiently waiting for. Beyond the slew of bug fixes, there&#8217;s some new features as well. One of which seems interesting enough to note: iChat encryption.</p>

<p>Wonder what people are chatting about that is important enough to encrypt. I personally wouldn&#8217;t mind Uncle Sam or teenager-next-door &#8220;listening in&#8221; on Matt and me babble on about iPods and cellphones.</p>
