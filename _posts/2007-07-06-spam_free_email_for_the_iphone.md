<p>Something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for years is strategically route all my email to a single, private account, and use a reply-to address that&#8217;s already known, memorable and branded. Ironically, the iPhone, and its lack of spam filter, became the perfect catalyst for me to set it up. (And no, I [still] don&#8217;t have an iPhone. I did this in enthusiastic preparation for my future iPhone purchase.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/email-routing.gif" border="0" height="430" width="300" alt="Diagram showing my email routing scheme" align="right" />First, I made sure all my publicly-known email addresses route to my <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> account. Google&#8217;s email application is quick, accessible, and free. Better than that, though, their spam protection is just about perfect; almost never returning false-positives, and never in need of an update.</p>

<p>Still, even with all its pluses, Gmail isn&#8217;t my final solution. The &#8220;conversational&#8221; approach doesn&#8217;t translate well across multiple platforms (such as the iPhone), and since it doesn&#8217;t support the IMAP protocol, it&#8217;s not ideal for using multiple clients &#8211; desktop or mobile.</p>

<p>Big kudos to Google, though, because Gmail filters spam upon receiving; meaning if you set a forward address, Gmail will only forward non-spam. Hooray!</p>

<p>All I had to do was create a new email (IMAP) account with my web host, set Gmail to forward to that account, and set the reply-to in my email client(s) to my branded address. All incoming mail is routed through Google, and all outgoing is shown coming from my public email address(es).</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the key</strong>: Of course, any curious and intelligent recipient can inspect the email headers and retrieve my &#8220;private&#8221; email address &#8211; <em>that&#8217;s okay</em>. Since I&#8217;m not going to give out that email address, I can easily (and regularly) change it. The only thing I need to update is Gmail&#8217;s forwarding settings.</p>

<p>Hopefully this solution will prove itself suitable when I&#8217;ve got my iPhone and can&#8217;t be bothered to delete all the spam I would normally receive &#8211; one at a time, since the mail app doesn&#8217;t allow multiple, simultaneous deletions.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://begoodnotbad.com/">Brian Warren</a> has pointed out that you can easily setup Mail.app to <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tip/2006/09/25.1.shtml">allow the reply-to address to be set on the fly</a>.</p>
