<p>I personally don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see the video iPod introduced next Wednesday, but apparently <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,171396,00.html">everyone</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9597131/">else</a> <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/bbc-6-music-report-video-ipod-set-to-debut-in-london-next-week/">does</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever. I&#8217;m not going to get excited until I see the iPhone from Apple (not Motorola, or Samsung, or NEC, or Sony Ericsson, or anyone else!).</p>

<p>(On second thought, I&#8217;d be excited about a camera iPod, I guess.)</p>
