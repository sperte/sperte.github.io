<p>&#8220;<a href="http://images.freshfjord.com/spunker/movies/thespunker.com.appleintelvspostalservice.mp4">Strike two for Apple</a>,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.joshuablankenship.com">Joshua</a>; and I agree. Apple has blatently ripped a music video from Postal Service with their recent ad (for the Intel iMac). What did that meeting look like?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Apple execs:</strong> We need something cool to promo our new Intel-based computers &#8230; ooh, something like that! (Gestures to the plasma TV on the wall showing MTV and &#8220;Such Great Heights&#8221; video playing.)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ad firm:</strong> Done!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gimme a break.</p>

<p class="update"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It <a href="http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/">would seem</a> this is a false alarm, and the director of the music video is also the director of the Apple ad &#8230; who just repurposed it. I don&#8217;t know whether to be pissed off or understanding &#8211; the idea is still cool.</p>
