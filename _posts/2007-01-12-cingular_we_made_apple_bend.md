<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/zd/20070110/tc_zd/198403">Cingular: We Made Apple Bend</a>. Or so says Cingular spokeperson and president of national distibution, Glenn Lurie. He goes onto call those who unlock GSM phones &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, and bad mouth small businesses. Somebody from AT&amp;T (not Cingular, right, guys?) better shut this guy up.</p>
