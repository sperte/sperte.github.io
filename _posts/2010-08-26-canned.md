<p><img src="/assets/img/canned.png" alt="Canned" border="0" width="157" height="151" align="right" />A few weeks ago I called an emergency meeting at <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon HQ</a>. The problem was I needed an app for a particular task, but all of the options available on the App Store at the time were &#8230; lacking.</p>

<p>I wanted a text message template app; something with which I could quickly launch, and send a text to my wife to let her know I was driving or in a meeting.</p>

<p>The men of the Balloon took up the cause, and today we have <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com/canned">Canned</a>, a light weight iPhone app for precomposed messages and pre-selected recipients.</p>
