<p>With my new Treo 650, Bluetooth, and [medium]-speed dial-up networking, I&#8217;m now fully-mobile. Even in the office! 
It took a little bit, but I got <abbr title="Dial-up Networking">DUN</abbr> working on my new Palm Treo 650. I can now access the internet on my laptop wherever I have cellular service using EDGE speeds. In the Seattle area, that means an average of 90kbps, which is slighly higher than bearable &#8230;</p>

<p>However, today I welcome such meager speeds. Our office internet connection has been crummy all day &#8211; literally stopping and starting, and always slow. Sites never fully load, connections to servers fail or get dropped, RSS feeds return &#8220;invalid,&#8221; etc. It&#8217;s a web developer&#8217;s worst frustration &#8211; available but horrible internet access.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a sad (but happy at the same time) day when your mobile phone gives better performance than your office network.</p>
