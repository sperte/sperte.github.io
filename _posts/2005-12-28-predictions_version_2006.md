<p>Here are my somewhat bold but somewhat boring predictions for the year of 2006. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design-wise: More gradients and the resurgence of neons</li>
<li>A new Apple.com</li>
<li>TiVo will find new life</li>
<li>Seahawks and Broncos in the Superbowl &#8230; or at least the &#8216;Hawks</li>
<li>Yet another friend of mine will be wed (congrats Matt and Rachel!)</li>
<li>Superman will flop, X-Men III will rock, MI-3 will bore</li>
<li>At least two Grammys for Imogen Heap</li>
<li>Four &#8220;iPod killers&#8221; will step and fall</li>
<li>One &#8220;iPod killer&#8221; will finally take some market share, but only because some superstar pushes it (besides Elton John, com&#8217;on people)</li>
<li>Vista will be delayed yet again and receive even more bad press</li>
<li>Narnia will be nominated, but not win, several awards from the Academy &#8211; because the Academy are idiots</li>
<li>More politically-bias movies</li>
<li>Faster-than-broadband wireless data will continue to gain popularity while VoIP and Skype-like mechanisms will begin showing their weaknesses</li>
<li>More AJAX and the rebirth of Flash in a brand new Adobe-branded diaper</li>
<li>A digital camera and phone from Apple, as well as the Intel PowerBooks</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s all I got for now. Gimme a break, half of that stuff I came up with in the shower this morning.</p>
