# Tagboard (V1)

Despite market and investor interest, Tagboard didn't have an actual product to demo after nine months of operations. I took it upon myself to design and develop the first prototype, which later evolved into Version 1 of the core product.

## From sketch to ship

I started by sketching some basic layout compositions I felt would lend themselves to the type of experience we hoped would resonate with users: a tiled mosaic, popularized by Pinterest.

From there I launched Photoshop to create low-fidelity mockups. I continued to iterate on ideas as I began experimenting in code -- adding styling and visual treatments along the way as necessary.

Once I had a working prototype built, I continued to refine the interface until there was a consensus that the core experience was solid. After that, I built out a simplified site structure and information hierarchy so that we could officially launch the product.
