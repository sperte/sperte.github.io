# Capture

<img src="/img/capture/hero.png">

As a new father I found myself missing important moments while fumbling through my iPhone's user interface, trying to get to the video camera. I knew there had to be a better way...

## A record button for your homescreen

I took the idea of building a quick-launch video camera to Sky Balloon, my 3-man team. After a bit of market research -- really only to make sure no one else was doing what we intended to do -- we began building Capture.

It took a lot of thought and work to make the app as simple as possible. Intentionally, Capture had next-to-no user experience to speak of: simply tap the icon to start recording video, and hit the home button to stop recording to save to your camera roll. The user interface was equally minimalistic by design. Our goal was to make it as quick and easy to record video on iPhone as possible.

Capture ranked in the top 3 apps in the Photography category and in the top 100 of all apps on the App Store in its first week. It was also featured on [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/07/20/useful.apps.sites.tools/index.html), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/record-video-in-an-instant-with-capture-app/), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/5818925/captures-big-fat-video-icon-starts-recording-as-soon-as-its-pressed), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/5819454/add-an-instant-record-button-to-your-home-screen-and-never-miss-the-money-shot), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2011/07/capture-app-a-record-button-for-your-home-screen/), and dozens of [smaller publications and blogs](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/capture-the-fastest-app-to-record-video-on-your-iphone/).
