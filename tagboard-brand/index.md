# Tagboard brand

As the design co-founder of a new technology startup the pressure was on to create a logo and associated brand that would help both establish and distinguish us in the market -- and it had to stand the test of time...

## Type, face, and mark

Research for the brand started months earlier as I surveyed various visual elements from across the technology industry, mostly from consumer brands and companies. I knew I wanted to create a simple brand that included the name in the logo -- a logotype -- but also recognized the need to have a strong icon or mark.

After test driving a bunch of typefaces and logotype combinations, I landed on a modified version of the brand name set in [Seravek](https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/seravek/), from the same foundry as the Facebook font, [Klavika](https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/). It satisfied the requirements of being familiar and friendly but was also customizable and felt high-brow.

I also created an icon mark that integrated the hash symbol and Seravek's lowercase "T".

## Color codified

As part of my research I also looked into color cognition and response. I knew color is an extremely important part of establishing a lasting and strong brand, and I determined although the blue-green spectrum of the wheel was overcrowded, breaking convention just for the sake of being unique wasn't wise, especially given the type of emotional reactions we wanted to engage -- things like friendliness, accessibility, ease of use, etc.

I created a base color scheme that included primary and secondary/accent colors that translated well (or mostly well) across mediums.

## Getting the brand back together

During the process, one unique tool I used to "test" the decisions I was making was a presentation slide deck. I wanted to tell a story with the brand, and used the slide deck to help anchor the story arch. Eventually I converted the deck into an internal pitch that I showed to my co-founders before officially launching the brand (by virtue of ordering business cards).

## Powered by Tagboard

It actually became an important part of our partnership strategy with source networks like Twitter and Facebook because if a public social screen had our logo it meant the content being shown was sanctioned. And despite early push-back from customers, the "Powered by Tagboard" badge eventually became a sort of badge of honor, signaling a company's forward-thinking and taste. (Tagboard has a reputation of having the best looking and most natural social screens).
