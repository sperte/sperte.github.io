                    Passbook is the first physical Remitly product. I designed the debit card, and in the process learned about plastic card manufacturing, technology, and personalization.</p>

            <h3>In 2011, I co-founded Tagboard, a social media software company. After creating the brand and first product prototype, I assumed a Chief Product Officer role and helped recruit and lead a team of designers and developers to build, deliver, and manage all of Tagboard’s products.</h3>
            <div class="grid">
                <img src="./images/tb-picaudi.jpg" alt="A Tagboard screen hangs over beautiful Audi cars at an automobile expo in LA">
                <img src="./images/tb-picstadium.jpg" alt="A Tagboard screen shows social media at a sporting event with tens of thousands in attendance">
                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Tagboard became an essential part of the social media ecosystem by providing a safe and easy way for organizations to display user-generated content in branded experiences, both digitally and out of home in real-world venues.</p>
                <img src="./images/tb-homepage.png" alt="The Tagboard homepage, circa 2015">

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">← ↓</span><br>
                    Tagboard&rsquo;s visual identity needed to strike a balance between trendy and timeless. I created a mark that integrated the hash symbol (#) and a lowercase T. I also created an accompanying brand guide, which included tone of voice.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Humble beginnings. I built the Tagboard prototype in a weekend using a CMS and some extensions. We used it to pitch the idea to investors, the solution to clients, and the vision to potential new hires.</p>

            <h3>I co-founded and was the principle designer at a small app development studio. We made single-use utility apps for iOS.</h3>
            <div class="grid">
                <img src="./images/sb-capture.png" alt="The Capture app icon and interface on an old iPhone 4">
                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">→</span><br>
                    Capture solved the problem of missing a special moment because the video camera took too long to launch. I designed the icon to mimic a physical record button, and the UI to do its job and stay out of the way.</p>
                <img src="./images/sb-canned.png" alt="Screenshots of the Canned interface, circa 2009">
                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Canned was a way to create reusable templates for text messages. We used mostly system UI, but I designed a custom control and UX for adding a specific recipient.</p>
                <img src="./images/sb-starbirdui.png" alt="A screenshot of the Starbird UI showing a single tweet in a card UI">

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">←</span><br>
                    Quality social media was being drowned out by noise, so Starbird was a way to follow people’s favorites instead of their tweets. I designed a fullscreen card interface and left-right swipe interaction experience.</p>

                    I designed, built, and managed dozens websites for the church&rsquo;s ministries and campaigns.</p>

                    I was responsible for creative and art direction for book and CD covers, as well as for events and sermon series.</p>

                    I helped design a campaign to invite a city-wide, controversial conversation about Jesus. I built a webapp which allowed visitors to anonymously fill in the blank, share their answer, view others&rsquo; answers (after they had been curated), and agree or disagree with them.</p>
