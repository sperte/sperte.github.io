                    Passbook is the first physical Remitly product. I designed the debit card, and in the process learned about plastic card manufacturing, technology, and personalization.</p>

            <h3>In 2011, I co-founded Tagboard, a social media software company. As Chief Product Officer I recruited and led a team of designers and developers to build, deliver, and manage all of Tagboard&rsquo;s products.</h3>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Tagboard became an essential part of the social media ecosystem, providing a safe and easy way for organizations to display user-generated content in branded experiences, both digitally and in real-world venues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">

                    Tagboard&rsquo;s visual identity needed to strike a balance between trendy and timeless. I created a mark that integrated the hash symbol (#) and a lowercase T. I also created an accompanying brand guide, which included tone of voice.</p>

                    Humble beginnings. I built the Tagboard prototype in a weekend using a CMS and some extensions. We used it to pitch to investors and potential new hires, as well as to our first customers.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">→</span><br>
                    Capture solved the problem of missing a special moment because the video camera took too long to launch. I designed the icon to mimic a physical record button, and the UI to do its job and stay out of the way.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Canned was a way to create reusable templates for text messages. We used mostly system UI, but I designed a custom control and UX for adding a specific recipient.</p>

                    Quality social media was being drowned out by noise, so Starbird was a way to follow people’s favorites instead of their tweets. I designed a fullscreen card interface and horizontal swipe interaction experience.</p>

                    I helped design a campaign to invite an open conversation about Jesus, the most controversial figure in history. I built a webapp which allowed visitors to anonymously fill in the blank, share their answer, view others&rsquo; answers (after they had been curated), and agree or disagree with them.</p>
