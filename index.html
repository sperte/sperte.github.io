                    Passbook is the first physical Remitly product. I designed the debit card, and in the process learned about plastic card manufacturing, technology, and personalization.</p>

                    I design the UX/UI for the Passbook app: from signup and onboarding, to account management, to money movement, and everything in between.</p>

            <h3>In 2011, I co-founded Tagboard, a social media presentation tool. After designing and building the first prototype, I moved into a product leadership role, and helped recruit and manage a team of both designers and developers.</h3>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Tagboard became an essential part of the social media ecosystem, providing a safe and easy way for organizations to display user-generated content in branded experiences, both digitally and in real-world venues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">→&nbsp;↓</span><br>
                    Tagboard&rsquo;s visual identity needed to strike a balance between trendy and timeless. I created a mark that integrated the hash symbol (#) and a lowercase T. I also created an accompanying brand guide, which included tone of voice.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    I built the initial Tagboard prototype in a weekend using a CMS and some extensions. We used it to pitch to investors and potential new hires. It remained the core of our product frontend for years until we eventually phased it out.</p>

            <h3>I co-founded and was the principal designer at a small app development studio. We made single-use utility apps for iOS.</h3>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">→</span><br>
                    Capture solved the problem of missing a special moment because the video camera took too long to launch. I designed the icon to mimic a physical record button, and the UI to do its job and stay out of the way.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">↑</span><br>
                    Canned was a way to create reusable templates for text messages. We used mostly system UI, but I designed a custom control and UX for adding a specific recipient.</p>

                <p class="explainer"><span class="pointer">←</span><br>
                    Quality social media was being drowned out by noise, so Starbird was a way to follow people’s favorites instead of their tweets. I designed a fullscreen card interface and horizontal swipe interaction experience.</p>

                    I helped design a campaign to invite an open conversation about Jesus, the most controversial figure in history. I built a webapp which allowed visitors to anonymously fill in the blank, share their answer, view others&rsquo; answers (after they had been curated), and agree or disagree with them.</p>
