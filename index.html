	<p>Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://tagboard.com">Tagboard</a> in Redmond, WA. I have over 20 years experience creating graphics, interfaces, presentations, and systems. While I have a wide gamut of tactical skills, I'm most proud of my strengths as a team leader and manager.</p>

	<p>In 2009, I co-founded a company called <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon</a> with two of my colleagues. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time, and have a user install base of over 300,000. Our most popular app is a quick-launch video camera, called Capture.</p>

	<p>In 2011, I left my career of almost 13 years to co-found Tagboard, a social media curation platform based on the hashtag. As Chief Product Officer, my role is to help lead and drive the product roadmap.</p>

	<p>Below is my blog.</p>
