<p>Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://tagboard.com">Tagboard</a> in Redmond, WA. I have over 20 years experience creating graphics, interfaces, presentations, and systems. While I have a wide gamut of tactical skills, I'm most proud of my strengths as a team leader and manager.</p>

<p>In 2009, I co-founded a company called <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon</a> with two friends. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time. Our most popular app is a quick-launch video camera, called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8">Capture</a>, with over 300k downloads.</p>

<p>In 2011, I left my career of almost 12 years to help start Tagboard, a social media curation platform based on the hashtag. As Chief Product Officer, I lead the design and development team, and drive the product roadmap.</p>
