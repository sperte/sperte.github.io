    <p>My apologies if you&#8217;re experiencing broken page errors and feed-related issues. I&#8217;ve done some housekeeping to my template files and reorganized a bit &#8211; it may require you update your RSS feeds:</p>

<p>&#8230; and what better time to do this than over a weekend, eh? Ugh.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/cingular_business_loophole">Cingular business loophole</a></h2>
    <p>Cingular Wireless offers special premier discounts and pricing for a number of large businesses &#8211; one of which is Apple Computers. The interesting thing is, in order to qualify for the discounts, all you need is an email account proving you&#8217;re an employee of the company. Here&#8217;s where the loophole comes in: .Mac email accounts work to prove Apple Store employment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cingular_premierdeals.jpg" width="180" height="163" alt="" class="imgright" />Today I was able to enter my own (.Mac) email account at Cingular&#8217;s homepage, qualify for the special pricing, receive the confirmation email, and access the &#8220;premier&#8221; section of their website. Apparently they offer up to 45% off handsets, though I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with the offerings. It&#8217;ll still cost you $199 for a RAZR or $449 for a Treo 650. They <em>did</em> offer the ROKR for only $149, but I restrained myself.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have the courage (or budget) to actually go through with an order, but I wonder how successful one could be using just their .Mac account. I also wonder if this is intentional on the part of Apple &#8211; as an added perk to being a member of .Mac &#8211; or an oversight. Either way, it&#8217;s one of the few unspoken benefits of being a .Mac member.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/ipods_with_a_purpose">iPods With a Purpose</a></h2>
    <p>I had this idea to buy, preload, and sell a bunch of video iPods. The idea worked. 
Recently my church put on a conference (<a href="http://www.thecity.org/index.php/special/pwp05">Prosperity With a Purpose</a>) that drew thousands of businessmen and church leaders from all over the world. The theme was &#8220;prosperity in third world countries&#8221; and we had speakers like Tommy Barnett (of the Dream Center in LA) and Tom Deuschle from Celebration Centre in Zimbabwe, Africa. The conference is hosted annually, and is free.</p>

<p>Anyway, prior to the conference (about a week before, actually) I pitched the idea of offering preloaded video iPods to attendees. We normally sell DVD&#8217;s and audio CD&#8217;s of each session immediately following anyway, so I thought we might as well encode the video and stick it on iPods. I asked for a small budget, thinking I&#8217;d buy just 5 30GB models, and setup a small table in the lobby to sell them. My boss liked the idea so much she said to get 10, and she&#8217;d have it announced from the pulpit.</p>

<p>Trying to reserve my excitement, I called the local Apple Store to see if they had any in stock &#8211; they did, but not many. I rushed down to pick them up, and got 5 white and 5 black. The rep who helped me was the &#8220;small business liason,&#8221; whatever that means. He told me that Apple was doing a better job at stocking the video iPods than they had with the nanos, but that they were still running low.</p>

<p>That weekend I did several tests to find the best method of preparing video. I quickly found encoding &#8220;for iPod&#8221; using QuickTime pro was a drag &#8211; taking sometimes close to double real-time (tests were done on a dual 1ghz G4). Both H.264 and MPEG4 video seemed to produce similar results as far as quality, and MPEG4 was definitely faster to encode, but still not fast enough &#8230; for me anyway.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">HandBrake</a>. HandBrake rips and encodes video straight from a DVD, and does it really fast. I averaged 45fps doing standard MPEG4, 700kbps, at 320x240 resolution. (Same dual 1ghz machine was used.)</p>

<p>The process was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Live session is recorded to DVD</li>
<li>DVD master is taken to duplication for immediate sales</li>
<li>A first-run copy of the DVD is brought to me</li>
<li>I encode the DVD session as the next session is happening</li>
</ol>

<p>When all was said and done the iPods were loaded and ready to go just hours after the last session. The total amount of content we loaded on was about 2.5GB worth, and took roughly 5 minutes to transfer over USB 2.0.</p>

<p>We sold all 10 iPods &#8230; the first night.</p>

<p>We had to make two more runs to the Apple Store to pick up iPods because people kept reserving them. Altogether, we sold a total of 41 iPods. We&#8217;re still selling them, in fact (though we&#8217;ve decided to stop buying, preloading, and selling the iPods and just sell the content itself on a data DVD).</p>

<p>In hindsight I know I should have taken some pictures of the event &#8211; me and Matt surrounded by 40+ iPods, packaging, cables, PowerBooks, etc. It was awesome. Maybe next time we&#8217;ll anticipate the demand better and actually have time to think about documenting our &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>NOTE: For those interested, all we did is remove the plastic wrapping from the box, peel the box (without damaging the sticker seal), cut access to the dock connector of the iPod, use our own cables to transfer the content, return the still-sealed iPod to its case, and slip in a small greeting/instruction sheet before closing it all back up. The packaging was kept as vanilla as possible to ensure the Apple-package-opening experience was untampered with.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s Wednesday (the day after) at 6:45pm and I still don&#8217;t own the DVD. My how my priorities have changed.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/apple_releases_1034">Apple releases 10.3.4</a></h2>
    <p>Apple [finally] released the OS 10.4.3 update we&#8217;ve all been so patiently waiting for. Beyond the slew of bug fixes, there&#8217;s some new features as well. One of which seems interesting enough to note: iChat encryption.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/ichat_encryption_thumb.jpg" onclick="window.open('/assets/img/ichat_encryption.jpg','popup','width=631,height=445,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="/assets/img/ichat_encryption_thumb.jpg" alt="" class="imgcenter" /></a></p>

<p>Wonder what people are chatting about that is important enough to encrypt. I personally wouldn&#8217;t mind Uncle Sam or teenager-next-door &#8220;listening in&#8221; on Matt and me babble on about iPods and cellphones.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/realign">Realign</a></h2>
    <p>I just read <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">an article</a> that is sure to change the way I approach design &#8230; in a good way. I&#8217;ve always respected <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com" title="Cameron Moll">Cameron Moll</a>, the author of the article. He&#8217;s a well-respected designer, but he&#8217;s also a great guy and <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000279.html">dad</a>. He&#8217;s also a good friend of a <a href="http://www.31three.com">good friend</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/realign.jpg" width="374" height="131" alt="" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>The article changed the way I think about design aesthetic and purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desire to redesign is aesthetic-driven, while the desire to realign is purpose-driven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#8217;re a designer, it&#8217;s definitely worth the 10 minutes: <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">Good Designers Redesign, Great Designers Realign</a></p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/apple_enhances_powerbooks">Apple &#8220;enhances&#8221; PowerBooks</a></h2>
    <p>Interesting word choice Apple is using for their HotNews article about the new PowerBooks. No upgrade, update or &#8220;new.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/enhanced_powerbooks.jpg" width="256" height="92" alt="" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I got a chance to play with an &#8220;enhanced&#8221; 15-inch PowerBook today and I must say it was nice. The extra pixels really do make a difference, and the trackpad (though not officially updated) felt a lot nicer and tracked better than mine &#8211; I have the 1.67ghz model, introduced earlier this year.</p>

<p>In my extremely professional lab test (turning off the lights and placing the two laptops next to each other), I concluded that the so-called increased brightness isn&#8217;t real-world evident. Meaning I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>

<p>But whatever. It&#8217;s probably the last &#8220;enhancement&#8221; this line will see, as most of the world is anxiously awaiting the dual-core or Intel PowerBooks.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/fontexplorer_x_followup">FontExplorer X followup</a></h2>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.31three.com/" title="Jesse">Jesse</a>, I&#8217;ve had somewhat of a breakthrough with my font situation. I&#8217;m now proud to report that my fonts are all organized, optimized and dutifully managed via FontExplorer X.</p>

<p>I think what it took was a little trust on my part. See, when a user&#8217;s so used to managing files the hard way, once a new (more intuitive) method is introduced to them, they sometimes have to unlearn what they&#8217;ve known to be the right way. I experienced this the first time I installed iTunes (version 1). &#8220;You mean it actually manages the song files for me using the ID3 information?!&#8221; I thought. Yes. And FontExplorer does the same, only with fonts. Imagine that.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/fontexplorer_mangage.jpg" width="268" height="33" alt="" class="imgright" />Now instead of managing the actual font files in the Finder, all I&#8217;m doing is organizing them inside FontExplorer, and letting the program handle the dirty work. The key for me was allowing FE to manage my files by <em>moving</em> them. It felt a bit like letting go of the reins, but once I did it, my 1000+ font collection became much more manageable.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/fontexplorer_x_amp_photoshops_fonts">FontExplorer X &amp; Photoshop&#8217;s fonts</a></h2>
    <p>I&#8217;ve been trying out <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX">FontExplorer X from LinoType</a> and I&#8217;m impressed so far (<a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/seansperte/entry/10_mac_apps/">remember, I included it in my 10 most favorite apps?</a>). I love the iTunes-like interface and the price (it&#8217;s, ahem, free). I must admit that when I first installed it I was a little confused as to how it managed fonts so I immediately reverted back to FontBook &#8211; I was under a deadline and had to have access to the fonts I needed immediately.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/adobe_font_path.jpg" width="209" height="107" alt="" class="imgright" />Now, after about a month of use, I&#8217;m still a bit confused. How come FE doesn&#8217;t manage Adobe Photoshop&#8217;s bundled fonts (stored in Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/)? So my copy of NewsGothic is different from Photoshop&#8217;s one? <img src="/assets/img/multiple_fonts.jpg" width="173" height="168" alt="" class="imgleft" />How come there&#8217;s two in my font menu? Should I go ahead and remove the bundled fonts from that location manually, and import them into FontExplorer? Should I leave them alone? I don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>Font management sucks. I kinda liked it better with FontBook (<em>gasp!</em>).</p>

    <p>Remember last week I mentioned I was holding out for the announcement of the &#8220;Sakura&#8221;? Well, that announcement came yesterday as the introduction of the Sony Ericsson W900. <a href="http://www.jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft</a> says Motorola should take a good hard look at it because it&#8217;s the true model of an iPhone, and I tend to agree.</p>

<p>Yes, I want one. More on this later.</p>
