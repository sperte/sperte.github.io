<p>Despite market and investor interest, Tagboard didn’t have an actual product to demo after nine months of operations. I took it upon myself to design and develop the first prototype, which later evolved into Version 1 of the core product.</p>

<h2 id="from-sketch-to-ship">From sketch to ship</h2>

<p>I started by sketching some basic layout compositions I felt would lend themselves to the type of experience we hoped would resonate with users: a tiled mosaic, popularized by Pinterest.</p>

<p><img src="sketch-to-ship.jpg" class="full" data-action="zoom" /></p>

<p>From there I launched Photoshop to create low-fidelity mockups. I continued to iterate on ideas as I began experimenting in code – adding styling and visual treatments along the way as necessary.</p>

<p>Once I had a working prototype built, I continued to refine the interface until there was a consensus that the core experience was solid. After that, I built out a simplified site structure and information hierarchy so that we could officially launch the product.</p>
