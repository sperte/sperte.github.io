		<p><img src="/assets/img/new-iphone.jpg" border="0" height="150" width="200" alt="Me and my new iPhone (box)" class="imgright" />Well, folks, I got my iPhone (courtesy of my generous and empathetic parents)! I&#8217;ll [hopefully] have a more detailed review later, but I can&#8217;t help but post a few initial thoughts. Keep in mind I&#8217;ve already had a month to play with friends&#8217; iPhones.</p>

<ol>
<li>The AT&amp;T sales rep said of the 490+ iPhones they&#8217;ve sold, only three had been returned &#8211; two for replacements, one because the owner couldn&#8217;t leave Verizon without breaking his contract.</li>
<li>My absolute favorite feature so far is the iPod muting when a call comes in.</li>
<li>If it wasn&#8217;t already clear to me, now I absolutely understand how 1.0 this software is &#8211; there&#8217;s no chance of listening to the iPod while surfing MobileSafari until a software update comes. </li>

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_mac_in_me">The Mac in Me</a></h2>
		<p>When Matt Heerema <a href="http://twitter.com/mheerema/statuses/132872532">called me</a> the poor-man&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber</a> I realized I should probably explain my preoccupation with all things Apple.</p>

<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve been a Macintosh user/owner since the mid-80&#8217;s &#8211; most of my life. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;ve used every OS since version 6</span>, and can recollect, without help from Google, the major changes in each revision. So I have a lot of personal history with Apple products.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest reason I&#8217;m such an Apple loyalist, though, is because I subscribe to the idea that technology should (and can) be as simple as it is powerful. Whether it&#8217;s the iPod or Mac OS, everything Apple produces seems designed to compliment &#8211; not hinder or add-to &#8211; my lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;m a perfectionist, I&#8217;m also very keen to the attention to detail Apple gives to their products. They&#8217;re polished, complete, and picture-perfect. Apple <del>never</del> <ins>rarely</ins> releases anything to the public without it having the white-glove inspection, and red-carpet treatment.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not all about the hype, either. Their great communication is only possible because of their <em>insanely</em> great products. Take, for instance, the iPhone commercials: Notice the lack of bulleted lists of features, pricing, and on-screen graphics. They&#8217;re just 30 seconds of the product, and the interface &#8211; center-stage, no CG and &lt;a href="http://www.cnettv.com/9710-1_53-28172.html?k="iphone"&amp;tag=cnetfd.vid"&gt;no trickery.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to discredit the awesome marketing team behind Apple&#8217;s campaigns. Whether TV spot, billboard, online graphic, etc.; there&#8217;s no confusing Apple message when promoting. Each ad is like a mini-movie &#8211; executed perfectly. Script, timing, story, continuity, style, tone &#8230; it&#8217;s all well-thought out.</p>

<p>I love &#8216;em. I love their style, their mission, and their model.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple&#8217;s not perfect. That attention to detail I mentioned isn&#8217;t always utilized in every release. Quality control has seemed to suffer as Apple&#8217;s popularity has grown. And lately the Mac OS is more an interface mash-up; anything but congruent. Actually, Apple frequently ignores their own interface guidelines, I guess in the name of innovation.</p>

<p>In that way, though, the company is even the more relatable. The truth is, if Apple didn&#8217;t have flaws I&#8217;d be worried. It&#8217;s the human element, imperfections included, that generates both its beauty and defect.</p>

<p>For me, the Mac, iPod and iPhone are easy to champion, because if I were to start a company it would look like Apple.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/spam_free_email_for_the_iphone">06 July 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/spam_free_email_for_the_iphone">Spam Free Email (For The iPhone)</a></h2>
		<p>Something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for years is strategically route all my email to a single, private account, and use a reply-to address that&#8217;s already known, memorable and branded. Ironically, the iPhone, and its lack of spam filter, became the perfect catalyst for me to set it up. (And no, I [still] don&#8217;t have an iPhone. I did this in enthusiastic preparation for my future iPhone purchase.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/email-routing.gif" border="0" height="430" width="300" alt="Diagram showing my email routing scheme" class="imgright" />First, I made sure all my publicly-known email addresses route to my <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> account. Google&#8217;s email application is quick, accessible, and free. Better than that, though, their spam protection is just about perfect; almost never returning false-positives, and never in need of an update.</p>

<p>Still, even with all its pluses, Gmail isn&#8217;t my final solution. The &#8220;conversational&#8221; approach doesn&#8217;t translate well across multiple platforms (such as the iPhone), and since it doesn&#8217;t support the IMAP protocol, it&#8217;s not ideal for using multiple clients &#8211; desktop or mobile.</p>

<p>Big kudos to Google, though, because Gmail filters spam upon receiving; meaning if you set a forward address, Gmail will only forward non-spam. Hooray!</p>

<p>All I had to do was create a new email (IMAP) account with my web host, set Gmail to forward to that account, and set the reply-to in my email client(s) to my branded address. All incoming mail is routed through Google, and all outgoing is shown coming from my public email address(es).</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the key</strong>: Of course, any curious and intelligent recipient can inspect the email headers and retrieve my &#8220;private&#8221; email address &#8211; <em>that&#8217;s okay</em>. Since I&#8217;m not going to give out that email address, I can easily (and regularly) change it. The only thing I need to update is Gmail&#8217;s forwarding settings.</p>

<p>Hopefully this solution will prove itself suitable when I&#8217;ve got my iPhone and can&#8217;t be bothered to delete all the spam I would normally receive &#8211; one at a time, since the mail app doesn&#8217;t allow multiple, simultaneous deletions.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://begoodnotbad.com/">Brian Warren</a> has pointed out that you can easily setup Mail.app to <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tip/2006/09/25.1.shtml">allow the reply-to address to be set on the fly</a>.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/iphone_software_quirks">iPhone Software Quirks</a></h2>
		<p>For the sake of argument, and posterity, I&#8217;m going to keep a running list of the iPhone&#8217;s quirks which could potentially be fixed by software updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>No widescreen in SMS or Mail apps</li>
<li>No MMS app</li>
<li>Camera shutter is sluggish</li>
<li>Passwords are immediately masked on input &#8211; making it hard to ensure accuracy</li>
<li><del>No spam filtering, as <a href="http://twitter.com/gruber/statuses/128517412">reported by John Gruber</a></del> <ins><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/07/mac-webmail-now-does-server-side-spam-filtering/">[possibly fixed, 070807]</a></ins></li>
<li>No Exchange Server support (beyond using the IMAP protocol)</li>
<li>No To-Do&#8217;s [added 070701]</li>
<li>No Chat/IM [added 070701]</li>
<li>No voice activation/dialing [added 070701]</li>

<li>Camera doesn&#8217;t record video [added 070701]</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/07/how-to-make-the.html">Takes too many steps to make a call</a> [added 070701]</li>

<li>Cannot save images/files received via email [added 070727]</li>
<li>Launching SMS app is sluggish [added 070929]</li>
</ul>

<p>[Disclaimer: While perhaps critical in nature, this list is not a knock on the iPhone or Apple. If I were to compile a similar list for any other mobile phone on the market, it&#8217;d likely push into the hundreds. So don&#8217;t go there on me.]</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/hi_phone">23 June 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/hi_phone">Hi Phone</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/willworkforiphone2.gif" border="0" height="90" width="200" alt="Will Work for iPhone" class="imgright nostyle" />Well, here we are, less than one week away from the iPhone. It&#8217;s been a little over 5 months since it&#8217;s introduction, and the world &#8211; or, at least North America &#8211; is ready, cash-in-hand. One week from now we&#8217;ll know whether or not the affects of the Steve Jobs <abbr title="Reality Distortion Field">RDF</abbr> have reached all-time highs or if what Apple has produced is truly their third &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; consumer product.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written very little about the iPhone since January&#8217;s Macworld. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;ve found myself strangely content with my Blackberry Pearl</span>, and haven&#8217;t suffered from the usual mobile phone lust that motivates a new purchase every 3-4 months. That, along with some lingering questions about how the iPhone works, have left me unsure what I think about it. And then there are my three main <del>problems</del> <ins>concerns</ins> with the iPhone:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there an easy way to type a period without having to switch to the punctuation keyboard?</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t seen one demo, video or photo that would suggest you can. Every on-screen example of typing has ended with returns; no sentences or periods. (Another similar concern is whether or not the iPhone&#8217;s on-screen keyboard works in landscape mode &#8211; or, for that matter &#8211; whether or not every app will.)</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the Yahoo! Mail push support, is there any other way to get email pushed to the device?</p>

<p>Based on the guide tour video, it looks like the only options for auto-check are: &#8220;Manual,&#8221; &#8220;Every 15 minutes,&#8221; &#8220;Every 30 minutes,&#8221; and &#8220;Every hour.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>The standby screen (the one with the slide-unlock) appears useless beyond showing a picture and clock.</p>

<p>There is no status information about how many unread messages, email or voicemails shows. In order to see if you have any unread email you must press the sleep/wake button (on the top) and drag the unlock-slider &#8230; ? Not good. (There is, it appears, a setting to have the iPhone audibly notify you when new email has arrived.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The tension between <em>want</em> and <em>need</em></h3>

<p>Regardless of these concerns, and my peculiar contentment with my current mobile phone, I still want an iPhone &#8211; of course. Part of me wants it just to fulfill my personal brand, that I&#8217;m a fanboy who always has the latest Apple gear. I&#8217;d be lying to myself if I said I didn&#8217;t care that others I know are planning on getting one and I&#8217;m not. I care, baby. And I&#8217;m livid about it. Especially since I&#8217;m the one who introduced said others to Apple products. (Matt, you need a blog so I can link to it when I speak of you.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another part of me that wants one simply because I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m curious if it could (genuinely) replace an iPod and mobile phone combination. I&#8217;m curious if the mobile web really does work they way its advertised. I&#8217;m curious if I&#8217;d get better signal reception at my work. And I&#8217;m curious if having one would actually enhance my life.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious, but I doubt every one of those points.</p>

<p>And &#8230; I don&#8217;t need it.</p>

<h3>I believe</h3>

<p>I doubt it&#8217;s as good as advertised, yes, but <span class="pullquote">I still believe the iPhone will revolutionize the mobile market</span>. It will happen just like the iPod; only Apple will never gain the same marketshare it enjoys in the MP3 player space. This is obvious, of course, since they&#8217;re not even aiming to do so. The influence the iPhone will have won&#8217;t be in numbers, but in mental-space.</p>

<p>Mobile phone manufacturers (I&#8217;m looking at you Motorola) need to step up their game if they want to survive through the new interface-driven age that the iPhone will create. John Gruber said it best when he pointed out how the iPhone commercials are the first of their kind, touting (and showing) the phone&#8217;s user interface, not some bullet-list of features. You&#8217;d better believe the public is gonna start demanding a better experience from their devices after the iPhone hits the shelves.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on syncing.</p>

<h3>Will work for iPhone</h3>

<p>So, getting back to my want for an iPhone, I&#8217;d like to use this opportunity to offer my services to those in need of a quick design, website or logo. My time is very limited, but if you have the budget, I have the skill. Do let me know <a href="mailto:sean@sperte.com">via email</a> if there&#8217;s anything I can do for you &#8230; in the next 6 days.</p>

<p>And for those who&#8217;d like to put out the same or similar offer, here&#8217;s a little something you can use to assist your endeavors:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/img/willworkforiphone1.gif" border="0" height="90" width="200" alt="Will Work for iPhone (1)" class="nostyle" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/assets/img/willworkforiphone2.gif" border="0" height="90" width="200" alt="Will Work for iPhone (2)" class="nostyle" /><br />

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_coda_factor">The Coda Factor</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/coda-leaf.jpg" border="0" height="100" width="100" alt="The Coda leaf" class="imgright" />Until <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda">Coda</a>&#8217;s release, my workflow was relatively set and regimented. I used a simple combination of tools that consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design and imagery &#8211; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/">Photoshop CS3</a>.</li>
<li>Development and code &#8211; <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></li>
<li>File transfer &#8211; <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a></li>
<li>Testing &#8211; Safari and FireFox</li>
</ul>

<p>While Coda&#8217;s simplified approach to web development make it the perfect candidate to take the place of many of these individual programs &#8211; it promises one-window web development &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite there. I&#8217;ve found it actually <em>complicates</em> my workflow. And, unfortunately, the release of <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit">CSSEdit 2.5</a> and it&#8217;s powerful override and X-ray features make matters even worse for me.</p>

<p>To give you an idea, here&#8217;s an example of my current toolset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coda for simple FTP</li>
<li>Coda for simple HTML</li>
<li>Coda for previewing HTML changes</li>
<li>TextMate via &#8220;Edit in TextMate&#8221; for advanced HTML</li>
<li>CSSEdit for CSS</li>
<li>CSSEdit for previewing CSS changes</li>
<li>CSSEdit and Coda for copy/pasting final CSS code into live document</li>
<li>Safari textareas for certain ExpressionEngine pages</li>
<li>Safari to double-check the preview, or sometimes because I forget Coda has live previewing</li>
<li>FireFox to test how Mozilla treats the code</li>
<li>Various other testing on various other browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can plainly see, Coda has made my life <em>so</em> much easier. Not.</p>

<p>Even still, the key factor in my continuing to use Coda is the company its developed by (as well as its infancy). I&#8217;ve been a <a href="http://panic.com">Panic</a> user since the release of Audion, and they&#8217;ve earned my loyalty. It&#8217;s Panic&#8217;s software development philosophy that makes them so special. Their ideas aren&#8217;t original &#8211; or, perhaps &#8220;aren&#8217;t fundamentally innovative&#8221; is a better way to put it &#8211; but the way they implement those ideas is.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. I&#8217;m admitting to my masochistic software use <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/software_so_good">once again</a>. Aren&#8217;t these computers supposed to make our lives easier?</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/copy">Copy</a></h2>
		<p>Another <del>day</del> <ins>month</ins>, another great <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> article. This one about writing effective headlines (taglines) and copy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whoneedsheadlines">Who Needs Headlines?</a></p>

<p>Speaking of writing, I noticed after completing a recent project, that I had spent the majority of time one part in particular &#8211; even though it represented a very small percentage of the visual design. The project was a redesign of our church bulletin (the handout given to attenders as they come into the building), and the part that took the longest was the &#8220;welcome&#8221; tagline, which read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to The City Church</p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;re so glad you chose to come to church today, and we hope you&#8217;ll experience God&#8217;s goodness and blessing at our services. Welcome home!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tcc-bulletin.jpg" border="0" height="388" width="639" alt="The City Church bulletin, and highlighted 'welcome' tagline" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>In that short statement, (hopefully) a lot is communicated.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, we&#8217;re partnering with the reader and celebrating their [bold] decision to come to church.</p>

<p>We understand it&#8217;s not always an easy decision to make on a Sunday morning, and there are a lot of reasons to not. The very act of church attendance is a vital step to a fruitful relationship with God, so we honor it.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we offer support in the form of an indirect invitation to <em>experience</em> something &#8211; beyond just church as usual.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s any question as to why a visitor is attending, we hope to put that to rest by communicating some simple expectations that they can adopt and share. After all, some people don&#8217;t have a clue why they show up on Sundays.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the &#8220;welcome home&#8221; statement is designed to add another layer of comfort and family-like reception.</p>

<p>I debated this statement because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound presumptuous or proud. I needed a strong conclusion, though, and nothing else seemed to fit quite the same way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first run of bulletins were handed out this past Sunday, and I&#8217;ve not yet heard how they were received; and I may never hear. Whether the copy I wrote actually made any difference to a visitor I&#8217;ll probably never know. After reading the ALA article, though, I at least feel justified in taking the extra time to make sure it was right.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/expression_engine_and_the_power_of_url_segments">ExpressionEngine and the Power of URL Segments</a></h2>
		<p>I <a href="http://blog.virb.com/entries/blog-import-feature-is-live">had need</a> today to serve a separated RSS feed of just my blog articles &#8211; sans links and quick-posts. At first I thought I&#8217;d simply duplicate my RSS template and call it something like <code>rss-blog.php</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah right. Not with ExpressionEngine and its support for URL segment conditionals around. Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention, because this is all it took: <code>if segment_3 != 'blog'</code></p>

<p>Now, the when the URL is <code>http://seansperte.com/rss/blog</code> I can show unique content by placing it inside the <code>if</code> statement, like so:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>weblog=&quot;blog1&#123;if segment_3 != &apos;blog&apos;&#125;|blog2&#123;/if&#125;&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>See how that works? See how easy?</p>

		<p>[This article has been updated <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/07/friends-followers-and-notifications.html">after Twitter made some changes</a> to the semantics of their services, especially regarding &#8220;friends&#8221; and notifications.]</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been labeled as web-based chat, microblogging, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.smallbusinessbrief.com/articles/marketing/008115.html">mobile social software</a>&#8221;. John Gruber, web and technology pundit, said, &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/march#wed-21-kottke_twitter">Twitter is to IM and SMS what weblogs were to email and Usenet</a>&#8221;, while critics say it&#8217;s just another social networking website, or <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2007-04-05-twitter_N.htm">an added distraction</a> in an already over-distracted culture.</p>

<p>I think Twitter is more than all that &#8211; or at least the <em>idea</em> behind Twitter is.</p>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>Twitter, at the core, is a <strong>method of communication</strong>. It is, in fact, not a new method, but it&#8217;s a simple one. <span class="pullquote">What makes it special is the mobile support</span>, wherein a user can interact with Twitter via <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before I go further, let&#8217;s look at what protocols (or methods) Twitter uses. There are three main ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web</li>
<li>IM</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ol>

<p>All three protocols allow you to answer the question, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and have it posted on your Twitter profile page (and, as I&#8217;ll show you, also forwarded onto those &#8220;following&#8221; you). To answer, simply text-message, IM or enter into web-form field whenever &#8211; or wherever &#8211; you want.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/twitter-statuses.jpg" border="0" height="98" width="200" alt="My Twitter status page" align="right" class="imgright" />Once you&#8217;ve sent your update (also known as &#8220;status&#8221; or &#8220;tweet&#8221; or a number of other terms relating), it appears on your Twitter profile page, and is automatically forwarded to other users who&#8217;ve chosen to follow you. This is where it gets a little tricky, though, because not everyone who choses to follow you will also chose to be notified. But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself &#8230;</p>

<h3>Followers</h3>

<p>There are two levels of Twitter profiles: <em>public</em> and <em>private</em>. A public profile is viewable online by everyone, but that user&#8217;s updates only get forwarded directly to users who follow them. A private profile is only viewable by those who&#8217;re set as friends by the owner of the profile. By default, a profile is set as public.</p>

<p>Following is inherently one-way &#8211; meaning if you choose to follow someone, you&#8217;ll receive their updates, but they won&#8217;t receive yours &#8230; that is, until they&#8217;ve reciprocally chosen to follow you.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you set your profile to private, you must approve followers. Once you do, the account relationship is automatically set both-ways and you&#8217;ll not only allow that follower to receive your updates, but you&#8217;ll also receive theirs.</p>

<p>If, say, you&#8217;ve chosen to follow a person but no longer wish to receive their updates on your phone or IM, you can set unique notification preferences to off. Their Twitter updates will still appear on your profile, and they will remain a followee (or friend) of yours.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note, now, that most (if not, all) handling of relationships and updates can be done via mobile phone using simple, natural commands. For example, if I wanted to turn off all notifications because I was in a meeting, I&#8217;d I&#8217;d simply text: <code>off</code>. Twitter will cease sending me any updates until I turn notifications back on.</p>

<p>To add a new followee, I simply text <code>follow [username]</code>. To invite a non-Twitter member: <code>invite [10-digit phone number]</code>. To turn off all notifications: <code>off</code>. Almost every function you&#8217;d need to be have mobile access to, you do.</p>

<p>You can even send a private message to a friend from a mobile phone, even if you don&#8217;t have their number. This came in handy for me while I was in Austin last month for SXSW. I was able to stay in constant communication with people I&#8217;d only met online and whose numbers I didn&#8217;t have, all through Twitter.</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>

<p>As I said, all this stuff isn&#8217;t really new. Twitter doesn&#8217;t bring <em>innovation</em> to the table so much as new <em>interaction</em> with innovation. What&#8217;s causing <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2007/03/15/tracking.shtml">Twitter&#8217;s astronomical growth</a> must have something to do with the uses people are coming up with for it. As a church staff member, I can think of at least a half-dozen off the top of my head!</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication with members</li>
<li>Communication with staff and pastors</li>
<li>Prayer alerts</li>
<li>Thought of the day from pastor</li>
<li>Mission trip communication (<a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=44">Twitter supports international numbers</a>, too!)</li>
<li>Multi-site service coordination (we&#8217;re already testing this possible use out)</li>
<li>Small group leader can keep in touch with members</li>
<li>Volunteer network can receive updates of schedule or procedure</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">John Edwards</a>, politician and presidential candidate, is on Twitter. <a href="http://twitter.com/foxnews">Fox News</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wsj">The Wall Streen Journal</a> tweet their headlines. <span class="pullquote">Heck, even <a href="http://twitter.com/santaclaus">Santa&#8217;s Twittering</a></span> now!</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation">Twitter&#8217;s <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a> has even made possible some cool third-party applications: <a href="http://twittervision.com/">Twittervision</a>, <a href="http://twitterholic.com/">Twitterholic</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a>, and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>, to name a few.</p>

<p>You get the point.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my opinion that anyone wanting to take advantage of web, mobile or new media technology needs to get on the Twitter bandwagon &#8211; if for no other reason, for research and ideas. Like I said, the <em>idea</em> behind Twitter is one that I think will drive a new wave of social interaction.</p>

<p>Besides that, though, it&#8217;s just plain fun.</p>
