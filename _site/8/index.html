		<h1><a href="/">Geek &amp; Mild by Sean Sperte</a></h1>

		  <h2 id="intro">Hello. Welcome to the weblog of Sean Sperte. I've been posting my thoughts related to design, technology, and faith here since 2005.
 <a href="/about">More info &rarr;</a></h2>

  
  <div class="post">
    <h2><a href="/entry/ilove_my_iphone">iLove My iPhone</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/iphone1.jpg" border="0" height="188" width="250" alt="My iPhone (macro shot)" class="imgright" />It&#8217;s not what the iPhone does, it&#8217;s how it does it; or how <em>you</em> do it <em>using</em> the iPhone. That fact, though stated in nearly every review of the iPhone, is hard to understand without personal experience. After three weeks of owning one of these revolutionary devices, I think I&#8217;m finally starting to get it. The iPhone is a joy to <em>use</em>. (Since when have you been able to say that about anything you own?)</p>

<h3>First impressions</h3>

<p>My first impressions of the iPhone came with a trunk-full of technical knowledge of how the device behaves. I&#8217;ll freely admit that before buying it I&#8217;d watched the 20-minute walkthrough video, read the manual, and scoured the web for every comprehensive review I could find. I was, for all intents and purposes, obsessed with it.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">What I didn&#8217;t expect was how good the iPhone actually felt in my hand</span>. The moment I was able to hold an iPhone (not connected to a security cable) was the moment I realized &#8211; <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/iphone_software_quirks/">despite the obvious drawbacks</a> &#8211; I had to own one. It&#8217;s the perfect size and weight; not too heavy, but enough so that you know to handle it with care.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the screen. It goes without saying, but the iPhone&#8217;s screen is the best on a personal electronic device, period. It&#8217;s clear, bright, and big. Actually, I happen to think that most of the physical appeal of the iPhone can be attributed to the screen itself, and not the form-factor, industrial design or Apple logo on the back. It&#8217;s just another cool-looking device &#8230; until the screen is activated.</p>

<h3>The keyboard</h3>

<p>The on-screen, software keyboard takes getting used to, but I got used to it in only a few hours. According to the type test I just took, I average about 45 words per minute (with some errors). I doubt I ever got that fast on my BlackBerry, even though I know I was faster on it than my Treo 650.</p>

<p>Even still, I would love to see a few minor modifications done to the keyboard:</p>

<ol>
<li>A &#8220;double-space for period&#8221; option</li>
<li>Clearer (or easier) way to deny the auto-completion/correct suggestion (the &#8220;x&#8221; is sometimes hard to hit)</li>
<li>More congruent auto-capitalization support</li>
</ol>

<p>Either one-handed or two, the keyboard is a hit with me. Way to go, Apple.</p>

<h3>A smartphone that syncs?</h3>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true. The iPhone does a great job of synchronizing data. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t sync To-Do&#8217;s or Notes. It seems to be public opinion that Apple will eventually build in support for those, but as of now, Notes are basically useless (why even include it?), and you&#8217;ll have to come up with another way of <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr>&#8216;ing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not had any problems syncing my data or media (800+ songs, 1000+ photos, and 10+ videos/movies worth), but I do wish I wasn&#8217;t handcuffed to iTunes to do so. And speaking of being handcuffed, why do I have to use the USB cable every time I want to update my calendar or contacts? It seems to me that data synchronization could easily be done via Bluetooth or over-the-air using .Mac.</p>

<h3>It makes calls!</h3>

<p>According to Steve Jobs, the killer app is supposed to be making calls. Since I&#8217;m not a heavy phone user, it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether or not that&#8217;s the case. The phone app is really well thought out, though, and hasn&#8217;t disappointed at all.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/iphone2.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="188" alt="An active call on the iPhone" class="imgleft" />Incoming calls take over the screen (no matter which app you&#8217;re in, or what you&#8217;re doing). The display shows the caller&#8217;s name or number (depending on whether or not you have them in your contacts list), their picture (again, depending on their contact status), and a two buttons; for answering or ignoring the call. Once in an active call, the on-screen controls for placing the call on hold, making another call, looking up a number, entering a number, or placing the phone in speaker-phone mode are big, bold, and clear. You can even return to the home screen and activate another app while still on the call.</p>

<p>Making a call is very simple, but does feel like it takes a few more steps than it should. First, you launch the phone app, then navigate to the desired screen for either Favorites, Recents, Contact List, or the traditional numeric keypad, then tap the name or enter the number. If you select a name in the Contact List, you must also then tap the desired phone number for that person. If I had a greater need to make regular calls, I would probably find the process frustrating, but since I&#8217;m just a casual caller it works fine.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T&#8217;s signal is mediocre; not great, not horrible. I&#8217;ve dropped three calls so far (two the first day). In most areas of Redmond and Bellevue, Washington, I get full signal. Frequently, though, the signal will suddenly drop to zero for 2&#8211;3 seconds, then pop back up to full. As for data, speeds on EDGE are <em>just</em> bearable. I just tested (with full signal strength) and got 149.5kbps. I must be getting the &#8220;updated&#8221; EDGE speeds, though, because I don&#8217;t find it as slow as some claim it to be.</p>

<h3>Lightning round</h3>

<p>In no particular order, here are some additional notes I&#8217;ve been compiling, but don&#8217;t really need to elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos look absolutely gorgeous. I start my demos with them; especially because the &#8220;pinch&#8221; effect always gets an &#8220;ooh&#8221;.</li>
<li>The camera confuses me &#8230; why such a nice camera, with crummy pictures, and barely any functionality?</li>
<li>MobileMail can&#8217;t save pictures?!</li>
<li>Standby screen is only semi-useless; it shows the latest, unread text message, clock, and date.</li>
<li>Weather is awesome (check out the additional info via &#8220;Y!&#8221; link). Stocks are cool. Where&#8217;s the &#8220;Scores&#8221; app?</li>
<li>Battery life is good, but I still have to charge nightly.</li>
<li>iPod is absolutely beautiful &#8211; the best part, in fact. The muting feature rocks!</li>
<li>Wish I could directly subscribe to and download podcasts.</li>
<li>Scrubbing long podcasts without chapters is just about impossible &#8211; but at least the fast forward is good. It gives audible feedback as the track forwards.</li>
<li>The apps feel somewhat disjointed (in terms of interface), and part of me wonders if Apple didn&#8217;t open up the iPhone for third-party development for that very reason &#8211; no real base for an SDK if there are no real standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The big picture</h3>

<p>What Apple&#8217;s done with the iPhone can&#8217;t be described as anything short of amazing. Nay-sayers who nitpick every quirk and omission are just haters, link-baiting and glamorizing the few negatives. If you take a step back and look at the overall satisfaction among iPhone owners, you cannot deny its success.</p>

<p>I absolutely love my iPhone, and wouldn&#8217;t go back to a &#8220;regular&#8221; mobile phone if you paid me.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/new-iphone.jpg" border="0" height="150" width="200" alt="Me and my new iPhone (box)" class="imgright" />Well, folks, I got my iPhone (courtesy of my generous and empathetic parents)! I&#8217;ll [hopefully] have a more detailed review later, but I can&#8217;t help but post a few initial thoughts. Keep in mind I&#8217;ve already had a month to play with friends&#8217; iPhones.</p>

<ol>
<li>The AT&amp;T sales rep said of the 490+ iPhones they&#8217;ve sold, only three had been returned &#8211; two for replacements, one because the owner couldn&#8217;t leave Verizon without breaking his contract.</li>
<li>My absolute favorite feature so far is the iPod muting when a call comes in.</li>
<li>If it wasn&#8217;t already clear to me, now I absolutely understand how 1.0 this software is &#8211; there&#8217;s no chance of listening to the iPod while surfing MobileSafari until a software update comes. </li>

    <h2><a href="/entry/the_mac_in_me">The Mac in Me</a></h2>
    <p>When Matt Heerema <a href="http://twitter.com/mheerema/statuses/132872532">called me</a> the poor-man&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber</a> I realized I should probably explain my preoccupation with all things Apple.</p>

<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve been a Macintosh user/owner since the mid-80&#8217;s &#8211; most of my life. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;ve used every OS since version 6</span>, and can recollect, without help from Google, the major changes in each revision. So I have a lot of personal history with Apple products.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest reason I&#8217;m such an Apple loyalist, though, is because I subscribe to the idea that technology should (and can) be as simple as it is powerful. Whether it&#8217;s the iPod or Mac OS, everything Apple produces seems designed to compliment &#8211; not hinder or add-to &#8211; my lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;m a perfectionist, I&#8217;m also very keen to the attention to detail Apple gives to their products. They&#8217;re polished, complete, and picture-perfect. Apple <del>never</del> <ins>rarely</ins> releases anything to the public without it having the white-glove inspection, and red-carpet treatment.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not all about the hype, either. Their great communication is only possible because of their <em>insanely</em> great products. Take, for instance, the iPhone commercials: Notice the lack of bulleted lists of features, pricing, and on-screen graphics. They&#8217;re just 30 seconds of the product, and the interface &#8211; center-stage, no CG and &lt;a href="http://www.cnettv.com/9710-1_53-28172.html?k="iphone"&amp;tag=cnetfd.vid"&gt;no trickery.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to discredit the awesome marketing team behind Apple&#8217;s campaigns. Whether TV spot, billboard, online graphic, etc.; there&#8217;s no confusing Apple message when promoting. Each ad is like a mini-movie &#8211; executed perfectly. Script, timing, story, continuity, style, tone &#8230; it&#8217;s all well-thought out.</p>

<p>I love &#8216;em. I love their style, their mission, and their model.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple&#8217;s not perfect. That attention to detail I mentioned isn&#8217;t always utilized in every release. Quality control has seemed to suffer as Apple&#8217;s popularity has grown. And lately the Mac OS is more an interface mash-up; anything but congruent. Actually, Apple frequently ignores their own interface guidelines, I guess in the name of innovation.</p>

<p>In that way, though, the company is even the more relatable. The truth is, if Apple didn&#8217;t have flaws I&#8217;d be worried. It&#8217;s the human element, imperfections included, that generates both its beauty and defect.</p>

<p>For me, the Mac, iPod and iPhone are easy to champion, because if I were to start a company it would look like Apple.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/spam_free_email_for_the_iphone">Spam Free Email (For The iPhone)</a></h2>
    <p>Something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for years is strategically route all my email to a single, private account, and use a reply-to address that&#8217;s already known, memorable and branded. Ironically, the iPhone, and its lack of spam filter, became the perfect catalyst for me to set it up. (And no, I [still] don&#8217;t have an iPhone. I did this in enthusiastic preparation for my future iPhone purchase.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/email-routing.gif" border="0" height="430" width="300" alt="Diagram showing my email routing scheme" class="imgright" />First, I made sure all my publicly-known email addresses route to my <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> account. Google&#8217;s email application is quick, accessible, and free. Better than that, though, their spam protection is just about perfect; almost never returning false-positives, and never in need of an update.</p>

<p>Still, even with all its pluses, Gmail isn&#8217;t my final solution. The &#8220;conversational&#8221; approach doesn&#8217;t translate well across multiple platforms (such as the iPhone), and since it doesn&#8217;t support the IMAP protocol, it&#8217;s not ideal for using multiple clients &#8211; desktop or mobile.</p>

<p>Big kudos to Google, though, because Gmail filters spam upon receiving; meaning if you set a forward address, Gmail will only forward non-spam. Hooray!</p>

<p>All I had to do was create a new email (IMAP) account with my web host, set Gmail to forward to that account, and set the reply-to in my email client(s) to my branded address. All incoming mail is routed through Google, and all outgoing is shown coming from my public email address(es).</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the key</strong>: Of course, any curious and intelligent recipient can inspect the email headers and retrieve my &#8220;private&#8221; email address &#8211; <em>that&#8217;s okay</em>. Since I&#8217;m not going to give out that email address, I can easily (and regularly) change it. The only thing I need to update is Gmail&#8217;s forwarding settings.</p>

<p>Hopefully this solution will prove itself suitable when I&#8217;ve got my iPhone and can&#8217;t be bothered to delete all the spam I would normally receive &#8211; one at a time, since the mail app doesn&#8217;t allow multiple, simultaneous deletions.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://begoodnotbad.com/">Brian Warren</a> has pointed out that you can easily setup Mail.app to <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tip/2006/09/25.1.shtml">allow the reply-to address to be set on the fly</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/iphone_software_quirks">iPhone Software Quirks</a></h2>
    <p>For the sake of argument, and posterity, I&#8217;m going to keep a running list of the iPhone&#8217;s quirks which could potentially be fixed by software updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>No widescreen in SMS or Mail apps</li>
<li>No MMS app</li>
<li>Camera shutter is sluggish</li>
<li>Passwords are immediately masked on input &#8211; making it hard to ensure accuracy</li>
<li><del>No spam filtering, as <a href="http://twitter.com/gruber/statuses/128517412">reported by John Gruber</a></del> <ins><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/07/mac-webmail-now-does-server-side-spam-filtering/">[possibly fixed, 070807]</a></ins></li>
<li>No Exchange Server support (beyond using the IMAP protocol)</li>
<li>No To-Do&#8217;s [added 070701]</li>
<li>No Chat/IM [added 070701]</li>
<li>No voice activation/dialing [added 070701]</li>

<li>Cannot save images/files received via email [added 070727]</li>
<li>Launching SMS app is sluggish [added 070929]</li>
</ul>

<p>[Disclaimer: While perhaps critical in nature, this list is not a knock on the iPhone or Apple. If I were to compile a similar list for any other mobile phone on the market, it&#8217;d likely push into the hundreds. So don&#8217;t go there on me.]</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/hi_phone">Hi Phone</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/willworkforiphone2.gif" border="0" height="90" width="200" alt="Will Work for iPhone" class="imgright nostyle" />Well, here we are, less than one week away from the iPhone. It&#8217;s been a little over 5 months since it&#8217;s introduction, and the world &#8211; or, at least North America &#8211; is ready, cash-in-hand. One week from now we&#8217;ll know whether or not the affects of the Steve Jobs <abbr title="Reality Distortion Field">RDF</abbr> have reached all-time highs or if what Apple has produced is truly their third &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; consumer product.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written very little about the iPhone since January&#8217;s Macworld. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;ve found myself strangely content with my Blackberry Pearl</span>, and haven&#8217;t suffered from the usual mobile phone lust that motivates a new purchase every 3-4 months. That, along with some lingering questions about how the iPhone works, have left me unsure what I think about it. And then there are my three main <del>problems</del> <ins>concerns</ins> with the iPhone:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there an easy way to type a period without having to switch to the punctuation keyboard?</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t seen one demo, video or photo that would suggest you can. Every on-screen example of typing has ended with returns; no sentences or periods. (Another similar concern is whether or not the iPhone&#8217;s on-screen keyboard works in landscape mode &#8211; or, for that matter &#8211; whether or not every app will.)</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the Yahoo! Mail push support, is there any other way to get email pushed to the device?</p>

<p>Based on the guide tour video, it looks like the only options for auto-check are: &#8220;Manual,&#8221; &#8220;Every 15 minutes,&#8221; &#8220;Every 30 minutes,&#8221; and &#8220;Every hour.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>The standby screen (the one with the slide-unlock) appears useless beyond showing a picture and clock.</p>

<p>There is no status information about how many unread messages, email or voicemails shows. In order to see if you have any unread email you must press the sleep/wake button (on the top) and drag the unlock-slider &#8230; ? Not good. (There is, it appears, a setting to have the iPhone audibly notify you when new email has arrived.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The tension between <em>want</em> and <em>need</em></h3>

<p>Regardless of these concerns, and my peculiar contentment with my current mobile phone, I still want an iPhone &#8211; of course. Part of me wants it just to fulfill my personal brand, that I&#8217;m a fanboy who always has the latest Apple gear. I&#8217;d be lying to myself if I said I didn&#8217;t care that others I know are planning on getting one and I&#8217;m not. I care, baby. And I&#8217;m livid about it. Especially since I&#8217;m the one who introduced said others to Apple products. (Matt, you need a blog so I can link to it when I speak of you.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another part of me that wants one simply because I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m curious if it could (genuinely) replace an iPod and mobile phone combination. I&#8217;m curious if the mobile web really does work they way its advertised. I&#8217;m curious if I&#8217;d get better signal reception at my work. And I&#8217;m curious if having one would actually enhance my life.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious, but I doubt every one of those points.</p>

<p>And &#8230; I don&#8217;t need it.</p>

<h3>I believe</h3>

<p>I doubt it&#8217;s as good as advertised, yes, but <span class="pullquote">I still believe the iPhone will revolutionize the mobile market</span>. It will happen just like the iPod; only Apple will never gain the same marketshare it enjoys in the MP3 player space. This is obvious, of course, since they&#8217;re not even aiming to do so. The influence the iPhone will have won&#8217;t be in numbers, but in mental-space.</p>

<p>Mobile phone manufacturers (I&#8217;m looking at you Motorola) need to step up their game if they want to survive through the new interface-driven age that the iPhone will create. John Gruber said it best when he pointed out how the iPhone commercials are the first of their kind, touting (and showing) the phone&#8217;s user interface, not some bullet-list of features. You&#8217;d better believe the public is gonna start demanding a better experience from their devices after the iPhone hits the shelves.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on syncing.</p>

<h3>Will work for iPhone</h3>

<p>So, getting back to my want for an iPhone, I&#8217;d like to use this opportunity to offer my services to those in need of a quick design, website or logo. My time is very limited, but if you have the budget, I have the skill. Do let me know <a href="mailto:sean@sperte.com">via email</a> if there&#8217;s anything I can do for you &#8230; in the next 6 days.</p>

<p>And for those who&#8217;d like to put out the same or similar offer, here&#8217;s a little something you can use to assist your endeavors:</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/the_coda_factor">The Coda Factor</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/coda-leaf.jpg" border="0" height="100" width="100" alt="The Coda leaf" class="imgright" />Until <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda">Coda</a>&#8217;s release, my workflow was relatively set and regimented. I used a simple combination of tools that consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design and imagery &#8211; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/">Photoshop CS3</a>.</li>
<li>Development and code &#8211; <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></li>
<li>File transfer &#8211; <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a></li>
<li>Testing &#8211; Safari and FireFox</li>
</ul>

<p>While Coda&#8217;s simplified approach to web development make it the perfect candidate to take the place of many of these individual programs &#8211; it promises one-window web development &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite there. I&#8217;ve found it actually <em>complicates</em> my workflow. And, unfortunately, the release of <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit">CSSEdit 2.5</a> and it&#8217;s powerful override and X-ray features make matters even worse for me.</p>

<p>To give you an idea, here&#8217;s an example of my current toolset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coda for simple FTP</li>

</ul>

<p>As you can plainly see, Coda has made my life <em>so</em> much easier. Not.</p>

<p>Even still, the key factor in my continuing to use Coda is the company its developed by (as well as its infancy). I&#8217;ve been a <a href="http://panic.com">Panic</a> user since the release of Audion, and they&#8217;ve earned my loyalty. It&#8217;s Panic&#8217;s software development philosophy that makes them so special. Their ideas aren&#8217;t original &#8211; or, perhaps &#8220;aren&#8217;t fundamentally innovative&#8221; is a better way to put it &#8211; but the way they implement those ideas is.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. I&#8217;m admitting to my masochistic software use <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/software_so_good">once again</a>. Aren&#8217;t these computers supposed to make our lives easier?</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/copy">Copy</a></h2>
    <p>Another <del>day</del> <ins>month</ins>, another great <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> article. This one about writing effective headlines (taglines) and copy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whoneedsheadlines">Who Needs Headlines?</a></p>

<p>Speaking of writing, I noticed after completing a recent project, that I had spent the majority of time one part in particular &#8211; even though it represented a very small percentage of the visual design. The project was a redesign of our church bulletin (the handout given to attenders as they come into the building), and the part that took the longest was the &#8220;welcome&#8221; tagline, which read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to The City Church</p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;re so glad you chose to come to church today, and we hope you&#8217;ll experience God&#8217;s goodness and blessing at our services. Welcome home!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tcc-bulletin.jpg" border="0" height="388" width="639" alt="The City Church bulletin, and highlighted 'welcome' tagline" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>In that short statement, (hopefully) a lot is communicated.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, we&#8217;re partnering with the reader and celebrating their [bold] decision to come to church.</p>

<p>We understand it&#8217;s not always an easy decision to make on a Sunday morning, and there are a lot of reasons to not. The very act of church attendance is a vital step to a fruitful relationship with God, so we honor it.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we offer support in the form of an indirect invitation to <em>experience</em> something &#8211; beyond just church as usual.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s any question as to why a visitor is attending, we hope to put that to rest by communicating some simple expectations that they can adopt and share. After all, some people don&#8217;t have a clue why they show up on Sundays.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the &#8220;welcome home&#8221; statement is designed to add another layer of comfort and family-like reception.</p>

<p>I debated this statement because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound presumptuous or proud. I needed a strong conclusion, though, and nothing else seemed to fit quite the same way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first run of bulletins were handed out this past Sunday, and I&#8217;ve not yet heard how they were received; and I may never hear. Whether the copy I wrote actually made any difference to a visitor I&#8217;ll probably never know. After reading the ALA article, though, I at least feel justified in taking the extra time to make sure it was right.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/expression_engine_and_the_power_of_url_segments">ExpressionEngine and the Power of URL Segments</a></h2>
    <p>I <a href="http://blog.virb.com/entries/blog-import-feature-is-live">had need</a> today to serve a separated RSS feed of just my blog articles &#8211; sans links and quick-posts. At first I thought I&#8217;d simply duplicate my RSS template and call it something like <code>rss-blog.php</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah right. Not with ExpressionEngine and its support for URL segment conditionals around. Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention, because this is all it took: <code>if segment_3 != 'blog'</code></p>

<p>Now, the when the URL is <code>http://seansperte.com/rss/blog</code> I can show unique content by placing it inside the <code>if</code> statement, like so:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>weblog=&quot;blog1&#123;if segment_3 != &apos;blog&apos;&#125;|blog2&#123;/if&#125;&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>See how that works? See how easy?</p>
