	<p>Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://tagboard.com">Tagboard</a> in Redmond, WA. I have over 20 years experience creating graphics, interfaces, presentations, and systems. While I have a wide gamut of tactical skills, I'm most proud of my strengths as a team leader and manager.</p>

	<p>In 2009, I co-founded a company called <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon</a> with two of my colleagues. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time, and have a user install base of over 300,000. Our most popular app is a quick-launch video camera, called Capture.</p>

	<p>In 2011, I left my career of almost 13 years to co-found Tagboard, a social media curation platform based on the hashtag. As Chief Product Officer, my role is to help lead and drive the product roadmap.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/apple_rips_postal_service_music_video">Apple rips Postal Service music video ... or not</a></h2>
		<p>&#8220;<a href="http://images.freshfjord.com/spunker/movies/thespunker.com.appleintelvspostalservice.mp4">Strike two for Apple</a>,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.joshuablankenship.com">Joshua</a>; and I agree. Apple has blatently ripped a music video from Postal Service with their recent ad (for the Intel iMac). What did that meeting look like?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Apple execs:</strong> We need something cool to promo our new Intel-based computers &#8230; ooh, something like that! (Gestures to the plasma TV on the wall showing MTV and &#8220;Such Great Heights&#8221; video playing.)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ad firm:</strong> Done!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gimme a break.</p>

<p class="update"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It <a href="http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/">would seem</a> this is a false alarm, and the director of the music video is also the director of the Apple ad &#8230; who just repurposed it. I don&#8217;t know whether to be pissed off or understanding &#8211; the idea is still cool.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/well_call_this_version_22">We&#8217;ll call this Version 2.2</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;ve made some minor changes to Geek &amp; Mild, as you&#8217;ll notice:</p>

<ul>
<li>New masthead (hoorah)</li>
<li>Clickable feed link on homepage - I&#8217;ve always had a feed available, but just via the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
<li>Ability to comment and link to Link entries</li>
<li>Denoted Link entries (the green &#8220;link&#8221; icon)</li>
<li>Some minor code/system enhancements</li>
<li>Fixed some comment bugs/quirks that supressed Textile&#8217;s HTML conversions (that&#8217;s for you, Simon)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still want to implement live preview for comments and upgrade to ExpressionEngine 1.4. I&#8217;m also developing an actual top-level navigation (you know, like a &#8220;real&#8221; website would have?) for about and archive pages. And, of course, I definitely want to add some kickin&#8217; AJAX stuff &#8230; All that in the future.</p>

<p>Anything else I need to do, like, ASAP?</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_macbook_pro">The MacBook Pro</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/macbookpro.jpg" width="100" height="78" class="imgright" />I&#8217;ve read several reactions to yesterday&#8217;s keynote, most of which are positive concerning the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">MacBook Pro</a> (and other new offerings from Apple), but there&#8217;s also a low rumble of complaint against the <em>name</em> of &#8220;MacBook Pro.&#8221; 
Just to get readers up to speed, here&#8217;s what the MacBook Pro really is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel-powered duo-core processor running at 1.67ghz and 1.83ghz</li>
<li>Up to <strong>four times</strong> faster than current PowerBook models</li>
<li>Same aluminum casing as PowerBook G4</li>
<li>15.5&#8221; screen, as bright as Cinema Displays</li>
<li>Same weight as 15&#8221; PowerBook G4</li>
<li>As thin as 17&#8221; PowerBook G4</li>
<li>New features include (but aren&#8217;t limited to): Built-in iSight camera, &#8220;MagSafe&#8221; power slot, IR port and Apple Remote, pre-installed Front Row</li>
</ul>

<p>So that&#8217;s the MacBook Pro. Of course, I want one.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/macbook_isight.jpg" width="380" height="205" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Steve Jobs said something key during the &#8230; uh &#8211; keynote. He said &#8220;we wanted all of our product line to have the name &#8216;Mac&#8217; in its title.&#8221; This tells you that the name was deeply considered before it was adopted. Other names have been suggested by the Mac community, but there are problems with each:</p>

<ul>
<li>iBook Pro - The iBook is branded as a consumer product already and simply adding a &#8220;Pro&#8221; to the title would confuse an already delicate branding situation. There&#8217;s also the fact that this is a <em>new product line</em>.</li>
<li>iMac Mobile/Portable - This makes no sense. The iMac is a desktop system and has been adopted as such; and again, it doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;I&#8217;m a new product.&#8221;</li>
<li>MobileMac - Would <em>you</em> want to walk into an Apple Store and ask for a &#8220;MobileMac?&#8221; Me neither.</li>
<li>MacPad - Doesn&#8217;t make as much sense as &#8220;book&#8221; and sounds more like an Apple accessory than a Pro product.</li>
<li>pMac - This is the best suggestion I&#8217;ve read/heard as it retains the &#8220;Mac&#8221; in the title while remaining simple and Apple-esque. The problem here is that the &#8220;p&#8221; would actually stand for something, while the &#8220;i&#8221; in iBook and iMac hasn&#8217;t ever been defined. Plus, &#8220;pMac&#8221; (probably) doesn&#8217;t look very cool when etched onto the aluminum casing.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, when you really think about it the name makes sense &#8230; and it&#8217;s starting to grow on me.</p>

<p>More of my thoughts soon.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I came across <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=311872&amp;tstart=0">a thread</a> on the Apple Discussions site in which one person had a great recommendation for the new laptop name: Macintosh ProBook. Now <em>that&#8217;s</em> a solid product name. Fits the bill, gets it done. Apple, are you listening?</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/iweb_does_the_web_right_sort_of">iWeb does the web right (sort of)</a></h2>
		<p>Well if <a href="http://www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog.html">this</a> is any indication of what we can expect from the Apple-designed templates in iWeb, I guess we&#8217;re not so bad off. The .Mac blog <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog.html">doesn&#8217;t validate</a> because of a non-existant (in XHTML 1.0) parameter in their JavaScript (&#8220;onload&#8221;), <strong>but it comes close</strong>. <del>All</del> <ins>Most</ins> of the CSS is inline, and looks like it gets optimized before it&#8217;s uploaded &#8211; how <em>well</em> it&#8217;s optimized is the question. The <a href="http://www.mac.com/web/en/Blog/Blog_files/Blog.css">generated external stylesheet</a> could definitely benefit from shorthand.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_dust_settles_in_san_fransisco">The dust settles in San Francisco</a></h2>
		<p>Today the Mac community simultaneously let out the breath they&#8217;ve been holding; and after the dust settled a new Intel-iMac and Intel-<del>PowerBook</del> <ins>MacBook</ins> were revealed.</p>

<p>Boasting speeds up to <strong>5 times faster</strong> than their predecessors, the new systems from Apple are available for order today (the laptop will ship in February). As of this writing the Apple Online Store is still down, but should reflect the new models and pricing by the time you read.</p>

<p>More of my thoughts later.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Apple&#8217;s posted the product page for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/intel/">Intel Macs page</a></p>

		<time><a href="/entry/newsvine_this_changes_everything">05 January 2006</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/newsvine_this_changes_everything">Newsvine: This changes everything</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/newsvine_logo.jpg" width="155" height="41" class="imgright" />Back in November <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog">Mike Davidson</a> announced what he&#8217;d been up to since leaving Disney&#8217;s media group and starting his own business. <a href="http://www.newsvine.com">Newsvine</a>, he said, was to be the new hotness in news, &#8220;just like your favorite news site, only smarter.&#8221; 
I have been (extremely) fortunate to be able to participate in the beta launch of Newsvine for the past few weeks and let me tell you &#8230; it lives up to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=newsvine&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Do a Google search for 'newsvine'">hype</a>. News hasn&#8217;t been the same for me lately.</p>

<h3>What Newsvine does right</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsvine_voting.jpg" width="110" height="29" class="imgright" />The way Newsvine makes news smarter is by giving control to the readers. This is done by enabling voting, live chat, and comment systems for every article (and seed, a submitted link to an external article). It sounds more simple than it is. But it sounds less powerful than it is, too. The potential this type of interaction has is truly culture-shocking &#8211; we may soon witness a shift in the way journalism is approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe in turning news into conversation,&#8221; Mike says. &#8220;It is only when readers interact with it that it achieves its full impact.&#8221; The life of a news story only comes from those who read it. No readers, no life. That&#8217;s what makes the current news medium so lifeless and Newsvine so &#8230; living. It&#8217;s the interaction, the personality, the relationship.</p>

<h3>The power of the &#8216;Vine</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsvine_mycolumn.jpg" width="175" height="216" class="imgleft" />Readers of Newsvine have the ability to create their own &#8220;column,&#8221; in which they post articles (similar to blog entries) and seed external articles. Seeding an article to the &#8216;Vine allows other readers the ability to view the article, comment on the seed, vote for it, discuss it in a chat room, add tags, and more.</p>

<p>On the front page of Newsvine (above the fold), news is displayed based on user activity, popularity, and post time. Only the most relevant stories are displayed; making the news seem more &#8220;living,&#8221; even before you read it. It feels revolutionary, really.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsvine_homepage.jpg" width="350" height="263" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had similar feelings before, but never in relationship to news &#8211; it&#8217;s been with things like iTunes, text messaging, wireless internet, real-time playback of uncompressed video. News, to me, is usually always boring. I&#8217;m much more of a skimmer: You know, glance at the headline, skim the text for relevancy, check out the photos &#8230; I&#8217;m definitely not the news-hound. With Newsvine, though, the news is living and current.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> more to Newsvine; so much, in fact that you have to see it to understand. Which brings us to &#8230;</p>

<h3>The public beta</h3>

<p>Today marked the first (okay, maybe the <em>second</em>) major public release of Newsvine, as they opened the doors for thousands who&#8217;d been on the waiting list. In addition, each user was given the ability to invite 20 other people to join in the beta. The Newsvine team says they&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks preparing their servers and systems for such an event &#8211; which is sure to bring huge amounts of hits and strain on the network. So far (tonight), though, the site&#8217;s snappy and fresh; like always.</p>

<p>My sincere hope is that they pull it off, and Newsvine does become the new hotness. Not only is the concept and execution really cool, but the guys who are behind it are genuine &#8230; and, well, local: They&#8217;re located right here in Seattle!</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/gcv4_part_1">30 December 2005</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/gcv4_part_1">GCv4: Part 1</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/gcv4_logo.jpg" width="185" height="124" class="imgright" />Generation Church is the youth ministry of the City Church, and they&#8217;ve been in need of a redesign of their website for quite a while. Last May we put up a temporary website, promising a new, feature-laden website &#8220;soon.&#8221; This move was designed to both motivate and excite &#8211; motivate a forced priority among other projects, and excite visitors of the site. It did the latter just fine, but because of the nature of ministry, priorities seem to shift based on immediate <em>need</em> (not desire); it wasn&#8217;t until about a month ago that I was able to really dedicate time and energy to the redesign.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the first post of a several post series about this project. If you&#8217;re not a web designer/developer/geek and don&#8217;t care about such intricacies as relative versus absolute positioning or workarounds for Internet Explorer on a PC, then by all means, skip this and go <a href="http://www.generationchurch.org/">straight to the meat</a>. 
The goals for the redesign (realign?) were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Update look and &#8220;feel&#8221; of site graphics to reflect the ministry itself</li>
<li>Provide an online destination for GC&#8217;ers to get news and announcements about GC</li>
<li>Provide an online destination for followup of watchers of GCTV, the ministry&#8217;s local television show</li>
<li>Reinforce the already-popular audio archive by increasing usability and availablity</li>
<li>Introduce new features that are fun and draw repeat visits</li>
<li>Provide an online catalog of small groups for GC&#8217;ers to pick and choose from to attend</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gcv4_listen.jpg" width="106" height="57" class="imgleft" />At least those were the goals I had in my head. Because of the type of project, and the necessity for a quick delivery, the usual formalities (of group discussion, brainstorming, goal setting and mapping, etc.) associated with web design were forsaken &#8211; in favor of just getting the thing up. In retrospect I would have liked to have at least clarified some <em>primary</em> goals. Oh well. Live and learn, right?</p>

<p>Without going into detail, once the project finally got off the ground, and I had an approved design comp to work with, I had to develop on the fly; meaning the development portion wasn&#8217;t scripted or planned out &#8211; it was a constant game of code-test-recode-test-code-test-recode-test-realign-code-test-trash-recode-test, etc. <strong>The site took its form in the development, not in the planning.</strong> In the end, the time gained by not having a set plan may have been spent in wasteful development. I say <em>may</em> only because many of the hours given towards the project were &#8211; let&#8217;s just say &#8211; not company-time.</p>

<p>The site was created, concept to (quasi) completion, in just over three weeks. Actually, 21 working days, to be exact. I&#8217;m still not fully satisfied with portions of the site structure itself, and there&#8217;s a lot left to do in terms of database management &#8211; not to mention the entire resources (store) section. Still, I&#8217;m proud of myself &#8211; in a I-can&#8217;t-believe-I-got-that-done-in-the-amount-of-time-I-did-it-must&#8217;ve-been-a-God-thing kind of way.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/gcv4_podcast_thumb.jpg" onclick="window.open('/assets/img/gcv4_podcast.jpg','popup','width=631,height=289,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="/assets/img/gcv4_podcast_thumb.jpg" width="198" height="88" class="imgcenter" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, just to list a <em>few</em> of the things still in the works:</p>

<ul>
<li>Completely separate cadre directory, enabling search and easier browsing</li>
<li>More &#8220;useful&#8221; audio archive, with summaries and tags</li>
<li>Podcast feeds for the other campuses</li>
<li>GCTV video podcast feed</li>
<li>Blogs (for Pastors Judah and Chelsea)</li>
<li>Contact page (duh)</li>
<li>Plus more that I can&#8217;t disclose ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s up now is actually only a beta version. I figured if the rest of the world (ahem, Google and Yahoo!) can launch beta websites then so can we. Besides, when is a website ever actually <em>done</em> anyway?</p>

<p>So, without further ado, I give you: <a href="http://www.generationchurch.org/">Generation Church version 4b</a>. (Originally launched Christmas day.)</p>

<p>Part 2 of this series will cover the design style and elements. Stay tuned.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/predictions_version_2006">Predictions version 2006</a></h2>
		<p>Here are my somewhat bold but somewhat boring predictions for the year of 2006. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design-wise: More gradients and the resurgence of neons</li>
<li>A new Apple.com</li>
<li>TiVo will find new life</li>
<li>Seahawks and Broncos in the Superbowl &#8230; or at least the &#8216;Hawks</li>
<li>Yet another friend of mine will be wed (congrats Matt and Rachel!)</li>
<li>Superman will flop, X-Men III will rock, MI-3 will bore</li>
<li>At least two Grammys for Imogen Heap</li>
<li>Four &#8220;iPod killers&#8221; will step and fall</li>
<li>One &#8220;iPod killer&#8221; will finally take some market share, but only because some superstar pushes it (besides Elton John, com&#8217;on people)</li>
<li>Vista will be delayed yet again and receive even more bad press</li>
<li>Narnia will be nominated, but not win, several awards from the Academy &#8211; because the Academy are idiots</li>
<li>More politically-bias movies</li>
<li>Faster-than-broadband wireless data will continue to gain popularity while VoIP and Skype-like mechanisms will begin showing their weaknesses</li>
<li>More AJAX and the rebirth of Flash in a brand new Adobe-branded diaper</li>
<li>A digital camera and phone from Apple, as well as the Intel PowerBooks</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s all I got for now. Gimme a break, half of that stuff I came up with in the shower this morning.</p>

		<p>Please forgive my lack of updates (or, at least, <em>substantial</em> updates) lately. I&#8217;m under a tight deadline and a lot of pressure at work. Things will probably resume to normal after Christmas.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Merry Christmas.</p>
