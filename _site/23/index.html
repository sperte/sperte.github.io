		<h2><a href="/entry/the_pen_tool">The pen tool</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m taking an Illustrator class right now. It&#8217;s a two-day crash course that I registered for almost three month ago; I would have completely spaced it out except for I got a reminder email last week from the school. 
I&#8217;ve taken these type of crash courses before so I knew what to expect today when I arrived. The room is small, which is a nice fit for the 8 of us enrolled. They put me on a Mac mini (with a Dell monitor), which I was surprised to find was somewhat snappy during the 8-hour training. I did, of course, what any well-mannered Mac fanatic would do as soon as I hopped on the machine: Checked the specs. They had put in 1GB of RAM and outfitted the thing with an AirPort card and Bluetooth. I had to change the resolution from the standard 1024x768 &#8230; what were they thinking? It&#8217;s an <em>Illustrator</em> class!</p>

<p>The instructor is knowledgable and friendly enough, and most of my classmates are keeping up well. Since my pen tool skillz have been on permanent campout in Suckville, I&#8217;m taking some of the extra time I have during the class (after finishing the exercises in half the time allotted) to polish them up.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m learning a lot and having a good time &#8211; I&#8217;ve just used Adobe products and Photoshop&#8217;s paths so much that most of the stuff being taught (so far) is review. Most of the stuff we covered today is almost second nature to me already. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be a bit more challenged tomorrow, as we begin more complex techniques.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a flower I made for my wife when I got home:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/illustrator_flower.jpg" width="237" height="218" alt="Illustration of a flower" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>It took about 90 seconds.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve got a problem. I&#8217;ve finally figured out how to mount a home directory on a file server at work &#8211; it&#8217;s a bit of a hack, but it works. In other words, my entire &#8220;home&#8221; directory is actually my user folder on the network, and the Mac mounts it as home. My Library, preferences, documents, music, photos, etc. are all stored and accessed on the network. It works great &#8230; except for FontExplorer, which seems to think it&#8217;s being launched for the first time, <em>every</em> time. It keeps wanting to go through the initial setup process.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s still beta, but why can&#8217;t it just work like every other program seems to?</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/itunes_variable_pricing">iTunes variable pricing</a></h2>
		<p>For the record, if Apple caves and begins selling songs in a variable pricing scheme, I&#8217;ll turn back to <a href="http://www.acquisitionx.com/">Aquisition</a> or <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/home.shtml">LimeWire</a>. The reason I don&#8217;t buy CD&#8217;s anymore is not because I&#8217;m stealing music; it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m buying the music (or more accurately, the <em>songs</em>) I want at a fixed price.</p>

<p>Apple has achieved a very, very nice balance for music purchasing. I&#8217;m not bothered (too much) by the DRM embedded in each song I buy, and I don&#8217;t mind paying $0.99 per song. Up that price, though, or change the DRM limitations, and I&#8217;m out like trout. I don&#8217;t mind saying I&#8217;m on the edge and could tip at the slightest shift in environment.</p>

<p>To Apple directly I say this: I understand you&#8217;re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You want to offer me the best and widest range of content to me at a great price, but those [edited] record labels keep tugging at your money pockets and driving you nuts. Well don&#8217;t listen to them. Since when have they done anything for you? Remember, you are who you are <em>not</em> because of the iPod but because of your <em>ideas</em>. You just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing &#8211; putting the music industry through digital rehabilitation &#8211; and let the record labels cough and hack until they&#8217;re &#8220;well&#8221; again.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m in the market to buy an iPod (as a gift) so I started to get frustrated when reports came in today that local Apple Stores hadn&#8217;t dropped prices on iPods &#8230; then I realized there&#8217;s no incentive for Apple to do so. Think about it, every day is &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; for Apple (the &#8220;black&#8221; being derived from the sales numbers being in the black, as opposed to the red). Oh well.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/how_to_boycott_sony">How to Boycott Sony</a></h2>
		<p>With last Friday&#8217;s announcement from Sony that they were going to temporarily discontinue production of the CD&#8217;s that contained &#8220;XCP&#8221; (the Sony DRM), I wish I could say the boycott is off. It&#8217;s not: The announcement was inadaquate compared to the crime, and unethical practices like these must be seriously addressed by the public. That means <strong>you</strong>. Click through to boycott Sony, even if you&#8217;re not fully convinced you need to yet. 
First thing&#8217;s first, you need to understand the situation. I&#8217;ll make this as plain and simple as I can: <em>Sony has knowingly voilated computer-users&#8217; rights by using a method of employing a copy-protection software that is more commonly used in spyware and virus attacks</em>. Need proof?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark&#8217;s Sysinternals reports in detail how this software is maliciously installed and masked: <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">Click here to read</a></li>
<li>Microsoft is calling the DRM spyware and will <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/archive/2005/11/12/414299.aspx">remove it automatically in its security updates</a> starting this month (as reported by the <a href="http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2005/11/microsoft_label.html">Washington Post</a>)</li>
<li>Sony is facing several lawsuits because of the DRM: <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27508">From the ALCEI</a>, <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004149.php">EFF</a>, and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/10/0024259&amp;from=rss">even the state of California</a></li>
<li>Programmers and coders all over the world responded with exasperation, asking, &#8220;what coder in their right mind would do something like this?&#8221; (<a href="http://www.pigdog.org/auto/software_jihad/link/2581.html">A &#8220;colorful&#8221; example</a>)</li>
<li>Boycotts have been called for, both in the blogsphere and now in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,69559,00.html?tw=rss.TOP">mainstream media</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so you now understand the seriousness of the situation, but what&#8217;s it to you, right? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you &#8211; <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/geekandmild/entry/rootkit_2_doom_and_gloom/">no, wait, I already told you</a>. If you still don&#8217;t think this affects you, then I ask you for you to help the boycott by shear courtesy to me and the rest of the freedom-loving world.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some reasons I&#8217;m boycotting Sony:</p>

<ul>
<li>I think what they&#8217;ve done deserves an extreme response</li>
<li>I like my digital freedoms more than I like Sony products, though I love Sony products and own many already</li>
<li>I want Sony to know that though I&#8217;ve been a patron of their company until now, practices like these make enemies</li>
<li>I truly want Sony to change, so I can continue to buy their stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>You ready to start boycotting now? Okay, we need to understand something: Sony wants to give consumers a good product/service almost as bad as they want the money consumers pay for it; they&#8217;re generally out to please consumers. So the boycott is going to be two-fold in its approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>We cease from purchasing goods and services from Sony (this means music, consumer electronics, feature films, etc.).</li>
<li>We tell Sony what we want</li>
</ol>

<p>The first step will hopefully tell Sony we&#8217;re serious enough about our purchases to trade inconvenience for freedom. They may never fully feel an economic bite, but hopefully the bark will be loud enough to scare them.</p>

<p>Secondly, we <em>must</em> give them a way out. I don&#8217;t know how we can deploy a mainstream way of doing this, so I&#8217;ve just emailed them directly and told them how I feel (<a href="http://www.seansperte.com/files/sony_boycott_letter.txt">read/download the text-only copy</a>). Feel free to use my letter as a template for your own, or just change the name if you want. It was difficult to find a place to send the letter, so I just used the Sony Music feedback form. I&#8217;m considering just using every feedback form I can find on Sony&#8217;s sites. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>So going back to our first mission, here are some things to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumer electronics, like radios, CD players, televisions (ugh, this one hurts)</li>
<li>Mobile devices like MP3 players, cellphones (Sony Ericsson), and digital cameras</li>
<li>Music from Sony BMG (even online from iTunes, or other music store)</li>
<li>Feature films like &#8220;The Da Vinci Code&#8221;, &#8220;Zathura&#8221;, and &#8220;Freedomland&#8221;</li>
<li>Games and the PSP (I know you wanted one for Christmas, but just wait until this is all over with and get yourself the PS3)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s not going to be easy, especially this Holiday season. However, I have to believe it will be worth it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: EFF seems to have a better grasp on the steps needed be taken by Sony in order to satisfy consumers: <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/?f=open-letter-2005-11-14.html">Read &#8220;An Open Letter to Sony-BMG&#8221;</a>.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/rootkit_2_doom_and_gloom">Rootkit 2: Doom and gloom</a></h2>
		<p>A followup on my post yesterday about the Sony rootkit issue, and why the DRM war is everyone&#8217;s battle. 
Where do I begin with this? Sony has a massive PR mess on their hands, one that could potentially spell disaster for their BMG division.</p>

<p>I was, as confessed, a wee bit off on the details in my last post. After investigating further I now understand the rootkit nature and the [admitted] reason for the software in the first place. Let&#8217;s rehash (again), shall we:</p>

<ol>
<li>A rights-protected CD from Sony BMG is bought and placed in a computer CD drive</li>
<li>The CD can be copied to three other &#8220;backup CD&#8217;s&#8221; but isn&#8217;t able to be played by Windows Media Player or any other CD player software but instead:</li>
<li>Asks to install and use its own software to play the CD (see the <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/sony-eula.htm">ELA</a>)</li>
<li>The installer places more than the named player on the computer, but also installs a rootkit, which cloaks Sony&#8217;s DRM software and a process called Aries.sys</li>
<li>Attempts to uncloak and unload the Sony DRM result in loss of CD drive operation (which can be restored with genius-like care and strategy)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now here&#8217;s where it gets interesting because, as <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/more-on-sony-dangerous-decloaking.html">Mark points out</a>, not only is this rootkit undisclosed, but there&#8217;s also no way to effectively uninstall the software. <strong>And Sony has yet to come clean about it!</strong></p>

<p>Since the story broke Sony (or First 4 Internet, the developers of the Sony DRM) has released a &#8220;Service Pack 2&#8221; which claims to &#8220;patch&#8221; the problem, but it only updates the Sony DRM and can <em>potentially crash the system</em> when unloading the drivers. Yeah, nice fix. Most users don&#8217;t even know there&#8217;s a problem (<em>since it&#8217;s a rootkit and hides every evidence of its existence</em>).</p>

<p>And there&#8217;s still no uninstaller &#8211; at least not one readily available to the public!</p>

<p>So here we are, midway through November, and still no formal apology or fix from Sony or <abbr title="First 4 Internet">F4I</abbr>. Here&#8217;s what Mark has to say (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; the EULA does not disclose the software’s use of cloaking or the fact that it comes with no uninst facility. An end user is not only installing software when they agree to the EULA, they are <strong>losing control of part of the computer</strong>, which has both reliability and security implications. There&#8217;s no way to ensure that you have up-to-date security patches for software you don&#8217;t know you have and there&#8217;s no way to remove, update or even identify hidden software that&#8217;s crashing your computer.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of admitting fault for installing a rootkit and installing it without proper disclosure, both Sony and First 4 Internet claim innocence. By not coming clean they are making clear to any potential customers that they are a not only technically incompetent, but also dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the quote/soundbite from Sony Global Digital Business prez:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people, I think, don’t even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As one commenter said, that&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;most people don&#8217;t even know what a thermite grenade is, so they won&#8217;t care if an active one is underneath their pillow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It gets even worse, though, because Sony is making this crap <abbr title="Standard Operating Procedure">SOP</abbr> before the end of the year, and <a href="http://www.xcp-aurora.com/press_article.aspx?art=aug_05_art3">others are following suit</a>.</p>

<p>This gets back to my previous post regarding the nature of DRM and the war that&#8217;s brewing. Make no mistake, our freedoms, be they digital or otherwise, are being threatened. It goes beyond being able to burn our own CD&#8217;s or listen to music; it stems all the way to the way we interact with each other online, the ability to download files, and even ownership of content we&#8217;ve <em>purchased</em>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the doom and gloom: The water&#8217;s already heating up, and if we&#8217;re not careful to take action, we&#8217;ll be boiling before we know it. We will be living in a rental world, where we own nothing and everything comes with a pricing scheme that rises and falls based on the whims of CEO&#8217;s and &#8220;creators&#8221; of content. The liberties we now have (to watch TV, record shows, buy and play movies, buy and play music, et al.) will be told of in stories, and remembered as the days of freedom and choice.</p>

<ul>
<li>We will no longer be able to show our friends our favorite track on the new Dave Matthews CD because our alloted playbacks have expired.</li>
<li>We will miss the cliff-hanger episode of our favorite show because even though we TiVo&#8217;d it, the system deleted it after a predefined time period, and we forgot to watch it before it had.</li>
<li>We will have to pay for each time we play a song, whether in the car, on iPod, from computer, as ringtone, or otherwise.</li>
<li>We will have to pay for every time we watch a DVD</li>
<li>We will have to pay extra for the burger at Red Robin because the franchise has to pay for each show on each TV they display, and each song that&#8217;s played, every time it&#8217;s played.</li>
<li>We will no longer be able to keep our home movies, because the maker of the camera we used embedded a destruction algorithm in the media that, if not paid for, will corrode the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>The possibilities go on, and get darker. Is DRM by nature evil? No. But just like money, what can come from the <em>love of it</em>, is evil. That is why this Sony thing scares me so much; and why I&#8217;m boycotting them. Once a company has become so paranoid about protecting their cash flow that they lower themselves to criminal-type methods of retaining control, they must be boycotted.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/rootkit">Rootkit</a></h2>
		<p>Thomas Hesse, President of Sony’s Global Digital Business, is not helping Sony clean up the mess they&#8217;ve made with the <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">DRM rootkit issue</a>. He&#8217;s quoted in this <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4989260">NPR brief</a> as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people, I think, don’t even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, Mr. Hesse, you&#8217;re partially right. I had no idea what a rootkit was &#8230; prior to two weeks ago. Now, however, I&#8217;m very aware, and care a great deal about it. I think the world&#8217;s about to find out what a rootkit is, too, and I think your company stands to lose a lot if you don&#8217;t shut your yapper and start loosening your grip on rights management.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of review of my readership, here&#8217;s a recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sony puts DRM&#8217;d CD&#8217;s on the market that &#8230;</li>
<li>Background-install a rootkit on PC computers (after a brief <abbr title="End-user License Agreement">ELA</abbr> message) that &#8230;</li>
<li>Monitors which tracks are played and whatever other information might be &#8220;relevant&#8221; until &#8230;</li>
<li>Mark&#8217;s Sysinternals reports that he&#8217;s discovered the rootkit forcing &#8230;</li>
<li>Sony [or Sony&#8217;s third-party developer] to issue a patch that supposedly &#8220;fixes&#8221; the rootkit, but in turn causes &#8230;</li>
<li>CD drives to be rendered inoperable.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/img/no_sony.gif" width="128" height="100" alt="Boycott Sony" class="imgright" />At least that&#8217;s how I understand the issue. The details may be sketchy, but who cares. The bottom line is that Sony is attemping to usurp the music market (from Apple) by using tactics only comparable to priracy. This crosses lines of ethical business practice, and in my opinion, should only be responded to in a <strong>boycott of the company and its products</strong>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr> fight is just heating up and there&#8217;s already losses on both sides. Hollywood, Nashville and companies like Sony (who make both the product and the content through their artist label) are bolstering their resources and throwing money at lawyers and technology in order to control their so-called empire of entertainment. At the same time, companies like Apple are taking advantage of this open opportunity and introducing new business models that are (seemingly) tolerated by consumers. The iPod is great not just because it&#8217;s white and cute; it&#8217;s an interface that <em>works with</em> DRM and still gives the consumer [at least the illusion of] ownership.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lose-lose for companies that don&#8217;t change their practices and adapt. Either they&#8217;ll waste their money on containment methods, or they&#8217;ll lose their market to companies that have already adapted. And it&#8217;s not enough to just adapt anymore: Now they must <em>innovate</em>. But that&#8217;s for another post &#8230;</p>
