		<h1><a href="/">Geek &amp; Mild by Sean Sperte</a></h1>

		  <h2 id="intro">Hello. Welcome to the weblog of Sean Sperte. I've been posting my thoughts related to design, technology, and faith here since 2005.
 <a href="/about">More info &rarr;</a></h2>

  
  <div class="post">
    <h2><a href="/2009/06/01/on_text_editors.html">On Text Editors</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/texteditors.png" alt="texteditors.png" border="0" width="242" height="102" class="imgright" />A web developer&#8217;s workflow hinges on their text editor. For me, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is the perfect text editor. I use it both for web development and casual text manipulation. I like that it&#8217;s both powerful &#8211; with shortcuts, bundles and expandability &#8211; and light weight &#8211; in that it launches quickly and performs actions fast.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried, and have licensed copies for, both <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> and <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>, and I really like both, but not enough to switch from TextMate. I&#8217;ve been thinking about why, and I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve never been educated on how to actually use them. I&#8217;ve read all the marketing copy, watched the developer screencasts, and even tried both in real-world situations. I must be doing something wrong, though, because I still don&#8217;t see the appeal over TextMate.</p>

<p>For instance, in TextMate, to &#8220;Insert Open/Close Tag&#8221; and add a paragraph, I type: <code>?+&lt;</code>, then <code>tab</code>, then write my paragraph, then <code>tab</code> again (to place the I-beam back outside the tag). Besides the actual paragraph, it takes three keystrokes. In Espresso there&#8217;s a similar &#8220;Insert Tag&#8221; icon in the menu bar, but no equivalent keystroke command, and even that doesn&#8217;t allow you to tab out of the tag. I haven&#8217;t found command like this in Coda.</p>

<p>So am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Indeed, I <em>was</em> missing something. Thanks to <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/on_text_editors/#c4">Ian Beck</a>, I&#8217;ve discovered <a href="http://wiki.macrabbit.com/forums/viewthread/160/">TEA</a>, and the powerful potential of &#8220;sugars&#8221; for Espresso. I&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/evaluating_espresso/">a video demonstration evaluating how Espresso and TEA are used</a>. Very nice.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2009/05/08/twitterrific_2.html">Twitterrific 2</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/twitterrific2.jpg" alt="twitterrific2.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="200" class="imgright" />The old pair of sneakers just got a new soul. <a href="http://twitterrific.com/iphone">Twitterrific</a>, the first-to-market iPhone Twitter client with a lickable UI, has been updated to version 2. And what an update!</p>

<p>The previous version of Twitterrific fell short of being perfect because it lacked many of the normal user functions that make up the Twitter experience. You couldn&#8217;t follow/unfollow, search, view conversations, use multiple accounts, or basically do anything beyond view and post tweets. With Twitterrific 2, you get all those and more.</p>

<p>As with the previous version, the main or default timeline view lists tweets from your friends, any mentions of your @username, and direct messages &#8211; all color-coded. They&#8217;re beautifully displayed in one of three themes: Raven, a light-on-dark theme (default); Snowy, a soft and light look (which resembles Tweetie&#8217;s default theme); and Basic, a flat but appealing, plain theme. Helvetica is used throughout.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where it gets good, though. The timeline can be viewed in one of three different sizes, selectable by a prominent button located in the top-right. The default view is the medium state, which shows an avatar, a real name, how long ago the tweet was posted, and, of course, the tweet itself. The larger view size displays a larger avatar and includes which client the user used when tweeting. The smaller size drops the avatar altogether, and displays the text in a smaller size. All three view states are nicely designed, and you can tell each had a lot of thought put into them. (A nice feature in all three states is the timestamp displayed in a different color for new or unread tweets.)</p>

<p>Tweets on the timeline are selectable with a tap. Once selected, an &#8220;actions&#8221; button gives you access to all kinds of functions you can perform with that tweet. You can view an associated comment thread, view the author&#8217;s profile, search the author&#8217;s @username, retweet, post a link (to the tweet), add it to your favorites, mark it, email a link (to the tweet), and, if the selected tweet is one you sent, delete it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the &#8220;compose&#8221; button becomes a &#8220;reply&#8221; button when a tweet is selected on the timeline. A nice feature.</p>

<p>A tweet is deselected by scrolling the timeline.</p>

<h3>Composing a tweet</h3>

<p>The compose screen is my favorite part of Twitterrific 2. You get all the normal functions &#8211; such as the ability to add a photo, your location, shorten URL&#8217;s, etc. &#8211; but there are some cool, unique features available as well. For instance, there&#8217;s a &#8220;Peak&#8221; button, labeled with an eye, that toggles a view of the timeline, so you can quickly reference a tweet. While in &#8220;Peak&#8221; mode you can instantly copy links and @usernames to the tweet you&#8217;re composing by tapping on them. Also, there&#8217;s a &#8220;Compress Text&#8221; function that attempts to shorten URLs and certain words as well as remove unnecessary spaces.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/twitterrific2b.png" alt="twitterrific2b.png" border="0" width="320" height="480" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Depending on context (whether you&#8217;ve selected a tweet before composing or not), you get three different inverted tabs for composing your tweet. One is for a normal tweet, one is a pre-populated reply pane (with the @username), and the last is a pre-populated Direct Message pane.</p>

<h3>Preferential treatment</h3>

<p>Version 2 comes with a boat-load of preference options, too. It supports multiple accounts with timeline preferences for each; notification preferences, with cute bird sounds and vibrate options (no background notifications yet); scrolling options for how the timeline behaves when new tweets arrive; a left-handed controls option; photo compression settings; auto-refresh settings; display preferences (for highlighting your tweets, using screen names rather than real names, showing avatars etc.); shortcuts for double- and triple-taps; instapaper support; privacy options; &#8230; and a ton of other things!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s got search, it&#8217;s got saved searches, it&#8217;s got trends, it&#8217;s got per-account icons, it&#8217;s got in-app browsing, it&#8217;s got URL shortening, it&#8217;s got &#8230;</p>

<p>Twitterrific 2 comes with so many settings and preferences you can get lost inside the Settings screens. They may have gone overboard with the customization options, I think.</p>

<h3>Behavioral economics</h3>

<p>Besides the ghastly amount of preferences, my only real critique with Twitterrific 2 is with its basic behaviors. Michael Mistretta took the words out of my <del>mouth</del> <ins>tweet</ins> <a href="https://twitter.com/definetheline/statuses/1741097275">in a reply to Gedeon Maheux</a>, one of the designers of Twitterrific:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] Just saying that for many first-time users, a tap = something happening. Not just a selection (like Macs).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The behavior of tapping a tweet in the timeline, then tapping  a button, then tapping an action, feels like a larger behavioral investment than should be required. Obviously there&#8217;s no way to present all the potential functional options to the user without somehow adding a menu or screen, but I can&#8217;t help but feel as though the catch-all action button is sort of a cop-out. Couldn&#8217;t there have been a better way? I&#8217;ll give you a for-instance.</p>

<p>For instance, the Reply, DM and Profile buttons could appear inline with the tweet when selected. This does two things: (1) gives the illusion that an action has already been performed after the tap, which lessens the perceived investment; and (2) saves an extra tap for the three most likely actions.</p>

<p>With all the polish and design-sense that&#8217;s evident throughout the rest of the app, I wonder how such a lazy solution was justified. That sounds harsh, but I suspect there was some major internal debate over that &#8220;Actions&#8221; button. I hope my opinion just gave one side some additional ammo.</p>

<h3>Filtering the timeline</h3>

<p>Another debatable feature is the Filter button, which allows you to select a view that includes only @mentions, DMs, favorites, your tweets or marked tweets. Since the default timeline includes all of these as inline tweets, decipherable by color, it&#8217;s nice to have the filter option.</p>

<p>For me the debate comes with how the filter is accessed. Again, it&#8217;s just a button. (And, in my opinion, it&#8217;s not a very good icon for the button.) I would have rather seen a page-curl type interaction like the Google Maps app has.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s no big deal, though, because the filter screen itself is beautiful &#8211; as are the colors and icons.</p>

<p>(A quick aside about marked tweets. Apparently there exists a need to mark and be able to reference a tweet outside the Favorites feature, because Twitterrific includes it. The unfortunate reality is that marked tweets are only useful to Twitterrific on the iPhone, and aren&#8217;t synced with any other app or service. Strange feature, I think.)</p>

<h3>No devil here</h3>

<p>The level of detail in Twitterrific 2 is outstanding. There&#8217;s no question that it remains the most beautiful Twitter client. The user profile screen is downright gorgeous. With the exception of the aforementioned two, all the icons and buttons are outstandingly designed. Glows, shadows, gradients &#8230; I could go on and on about the UI. It&#8217;s all so good looking.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a level of attention to detail in the app that is just plain exciting; has to be experienced to truly appreciate. I guess that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so confused with some of the design decisions that were made.</p>

<p>If you want to see some of the app in action, without installing it, <a href="http://twitterrific.com/iphone/tweetorials">check out their &#8220;tweetorial&#8221; videos</a>.</p>

<h3>Get it</h3>

<p><a href="http://twitterrific.com/iphone">Twitterrific 2</a> continues to be a free app, and a Premium version available that removes the in-timeline ads. The Premium version is now only $3.99 (down from $9.99), which is a steal. That they offer a free version is just sickening. Aren&#8217;t there laws about giving away this much Good?</p>

<p>All in all, I applaud the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/home">Icon Factory</a> guys, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry">Craig Hockenberry</a>, for this great update to a great app.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2009/05/05/nip_tuck_for_geek_mild.html">Nip &amp; Tuck for Geek &amp; Mild</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/gmredesign.jpg" alt="gmredesign.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="200" class="imgright" />Last night I launched a redesign of Geek &amp; Mild. Here&#8217;s some of the backstory on it, if you&#8217;re curious.</p>

<h3>The ampersand</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a big fan of the ampersand. Back when I was debating between names for my website, it was a big consideration. I wanted a name with an ampersand in the middle. (Cut from the list were &#8220;Apples &amp; Onions&#8221;, &#8220;Geekery &amp; Me&#8221;, and &#8220;Greek &amp; Geek&#8221;.)</p>

<p>When I began brainstorming a new design for Geek &amp; Mild, I wanted to make the ampersand a bigger focal point. Now it&#8217;s the most prominent graphic on the site. I&#8217;ve also refined the site logo and created a favicon, both of which feature the ampersand.</p>

<h3>&#8216;A lack of color here&#8217;</h3>

<p>Geek &amp; Mild has always sported a black and white color motif. It&#8217;s part of the brand. For this design I wanted to maintain that brand, but update it. I&#8217;ve done that by starting with black (#000000) and taking it one-step up (#222222), to a dark almost-black. And by starting with white (#ffffff) and doing the same, to an almost-white (#ededed). A gamut of grays &#8211; as well as the signature &#8220;highlight&#8221; yellow (#ffffcc) that I&#8217;m so fond of &#8211; accent the rest of the site detail.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a minimalist, so my blog reflects that. I&#8217;ve always maintained a minimal site navigation, but for the redesign I thought I&#8217;d push it even further. I wanted the navigation to be as organic as possible.</p>

<p>For the archives, I did away with a separate landing page, and created a small, widget-like link area to access all of Geek &amp; Mild&#8217;s previous content by month. It&#8217;s available on every page, viewable by moving the cursor near the right-hand side of the page. I&#8217;ll admit, the concept is very self-indulgent, but I think the design works well. We&#8217;ll see how it goes. So far I&#8217;ve heard only good things about it.</p>

<p>As for the About Me page &#8211; arguably one of the most important pages a website has &#8211; I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to perfectly (and naturally) integrate it. Right now you can find a link to it in the footer. This might prove sufficient, but my gut is that it won&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>Accouterments</h3>

<p>Some of the finer design details are the ones that are my favorite. For instance, the rounded corners (viewable in Safari and Firefox) on blockquotes, form fields, the pagination controls, and some links.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the introduction of the check-mark for the aside referral permalinks. (Notice, too, that I&#8217;ve dropped the &#8220;aside&#8221; label for those, and replaced it with [&#10003;].)</p>

<p>I heavily debated dropping support for comments, but I genuinely appreciate feedback, and believe that most of the comments I receive actually contribute to the discussion, rather than degrade it.</p>

<h3>Coming soon</h3>

<p>Still left to do is (1) a search option, (2) a mobile-phone optimized version, and, as mentioned, (3) a better way to access <a href="http://seansperte.com/about">About Me</a>.</p>

    <p>Let me explain something. The reason something like a &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/1530405887">Gracebook</a>&#8221; will never get my support &#8211; and the reason I sarcastically remarked about it &#8211; is because it&#8217;s a regurgitated idea.</p>

<p>So, just so we&#8217;re clear, here are some guidelines for creating a social network:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t create a network/service for a single demographic.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t charge money.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t name it anything stupid.</li>
</ol>

<p>We clear?</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/fusionads.jpg" alt="Fusion Ads" border="0" width="200" height="200" class="imgright" />If you visit my website you&#8217;ll notice a new feature: <a href="http://fusionads.net">Fusion Ads</a>. I debated accepting the invitation from the Fusion Ad Network for a long time &#8211; mostly because I&#8217;m not a big fan of web ads. What finally convinced me was my own interest in the ads as I saw them appear on all my favorite blogs (and now even software).</p>

<p>When I realized how compelling the ads were to me, and how many products and services advertised I actually used or owned, I figured they would be beneficial for readers of Geek &amp; Mild. And since I can&#8217;t always feature great software or services in posts or links, the ads will help augment that limitation.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a caterer. Some of the people I make food for are sitting at a lopsided table &#8211; which makes for an unpleasant eating experience, no matter where they get their food.</p>

<p>The question is this: Is it worth it for me to create a customized menu, equipped with plates and utensils that compensate for the table&#8217;s lopsidedness, for this segment of eaters?</p>

<p>I say no.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2009/04/08/comparing_ourselves_among_ourselves.html">Comparing Ourselves Among Ourselves</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/alasurvey.jpg" alt="alasurvey.jpg" border="0" width="200" height="200" class="imgright" />A List Apart has published <a href="http://aneventapart.com/alasurvey2008/">the results from their survey of people who make websites</a>. The data, which includes answers from over 30,000 respondents, is very clearly presented in web page format (meaning XHTML, tables, and CSS); a clever method, if you ask me.</p>

<p>What concerns me about this, as well as other surveys of similar vein, is that it fuels the fire of comparison inside this new and diverse industry. One of the reasons I so passionately do what I do (as a web designer/developer) is the organic feel of the web. You can approach design for the web with a clean slate and open mind and still be accepted. There are guidelines, yes; standards that we voluntarily submit to. But ultimately the web is an open platform wherein design autonomy is celebrated.</p>

<p>Comparison among those who make websites is helpful only as much as it contributes to the expansion of the medium itself. I fear, though, that comparing incomes, biases, and experience will result in over-inflated egos and mistuned motivations.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding overtly self-absorbed, I&#8217;ll use myself as a clear example of this. When I first discovered that the survey results had been posted, I immediately checked to see if my salary was on par with the median. I skipped past the introduction, the demographics, and everything else that preceded the subject of money.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not the kind of person I am. Why did I do that? Would the results &#8211; good news or bad news &#8211; somehow change the way I make websites?</p>

<p>This is an industry of Whoever, Wherever, Whenever (WWW), but if we let market norms dictate the direction we go, we&#8217;ll find ourselves in a spot we don&#8217;t want to be: where the great openness we celebrate is closed, and we&#8217;re all competing for the best seat in the house.</p>

    <p>For the past two weeks here in Seattle, Starbucks stores have been passing out sample packs of <a href="http://starbucks.com/via">VIA</a>, their new instant coffee. I tried my first cup last week and <a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/1259172314">tweeted my thoughts</a>: it was surprisingly good.</p>

<p>VIA <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008804732_viaside03.html">started as an idea 20 years ago</a> and is now a retail reality; a very good tasting reality.

    <h2><a href="/2008/12/07/Setting_Up_a_Killer_Local_Web_Development_Environment_on_a_Mac_with_MAMP_an.html">Setting Up a Killer, Local Web Development Environment on a Mac with MAMP and VirtualHostX</a></h2>
    <p>With a keen sense of internet awareness (Powered by Twitter&#8482;), I&#8217;ve observed a large amount of Switchers <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/other/new-macbook-pro/">whose day job is to build the web</a>. Because of this, I thought I&#8217;d provide a bit of a welcome gift, in the form of a small tutorial on setting up a killer work environment.</p>

<p>The setup I&#8217;m going to describe isn&#8217;t novel, nor is it for everyone. My workflow allows me to have a great deal of flexibility with how I develop (since I&#8217;m basically a one-man-department), so keep that in mind as you read. You may need to &#8220;season to taste&#8221;, so to speak.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<h3>MAMP</h3>

<p>The heart and soul of the environment we&#8217;re going to build comes from MAMP &#8211; Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP. <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp.html">The free version of MAMP</a> contains everything most developers need. Simply download, install and run it as you would any normal application. We&#8217;re going to make a couple of easy changes in the MAMP preferences.</p>

<p>The first is to change the ports that MAMP uses. Click on the &#8220;Ports&#8221; tab and set the Apache and MySQL ports to their defaults (80 and 3306, respectively). You&#8217;ll be prompted for your admin password.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/mamp-ports.jpg" alt="MAMP port settings" border="0" width="359" height="239" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Secondly, I like to uncheck all of the options in the &#8220;Start/Stop&#8221; section. This comes with some potential performance and security hits since it means you&#8217;ll have to manually stop the servers if/when you&#8217;re not using them.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about any other options. We&#8217;re going to circumvent MAMP&#8217;s default document root with virtual hosts.</p>

<h3>VirtualHostX</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/vhx-icon2.jpg" alt="vhx-icon2.jpg" class="imgright" />Now that we&#8217;re serving Apache+PHP, we can access whatever document root we have setup in the MAMP preference via a web browser with the URL http://localhost &#8211; but that sucks. Instead, we&#8217;re going to use virtual hosts, allowing any URL to any document root we want. That&#8217;s right. Any URL to any directory.</p>

<p>To do this, we can edit the Apache httpd.conf and hosts files manually, or use <a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">Tyler Hall&#8217;s fabulous VirtualHostX</a>, a $19 utility that provides a clean and simple GUI for adding virtual hosts.</p>

<p>On first launch, VHX will ask you to create a backup of the current configuration &#8211; which you should do. It also provides an option for installing MAMP support.</p>

<p>Creating a virtual host is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the domain name you&#8217;d like to use</li>
<li>Choose a &#8220;website folder&#8221; to be the document root for the domain</li>
<li>Apply changes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/vhx2.jpg" alt="vhx2.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! (You can add advanced, custom directives if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.)</p>

<p>One quick note: anytime you update the virtual hosts you should restart Apache (httpd) by stopping and starting the servers in VirtualHostX (command+shift+R).</p>

<h3>VMware Fusion</h3>

<p>At this point we have a near-perfect local development environment &#8211; except for testing. Sure this works great for testing in all the browsers you have available on your Mac (just type in the domain you chose in VHX in any browser you have installed). But what about testing how your sites look on a PC?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> (or another virtualization program) comes into play. Most of us (developers) already use virtualization in some form for testing, but in order to take advantage of this particular environment &#8211; MAMP with virtual hosts &#8211; we need to update the hosts file on the virtual machine so that it resolves the domains to the Mac&#8217;s IP.</p>

<p>One catch: if you&#8217;re on a latop, chances are the Mac&#8217;s IP will change often. That&#8217;s why we need to get the secret IP the VM uses to talk to the Mac. (Yeah, I didn&#8217;t know such a thing existed either.) Here&#8217;s how we find it:</p>

<p>Type <code>ifconfig vmnet1</code> into a Terminal window. You should get a return like this:</p>

<pre><code>vmnet1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
    inet 192.168.115.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.115.255
    ether 00:50:56:c0:00:01
</code></pre>

<p>The &#8220;inet&#8221; number is your &#8220;secret&#8221; IP (in my case, 192.168.115.1).</p>

<p>Now that we have that number, we can edit the hosts file on the VM. We find it in: <code>C:/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc</code>. Just open the host file with Notepad, and add each virtual host (domain) on it&#8217;s own line at the end of the document, like so:</p>

<pre><code>192.168.115.1  dev.triumphofgrace.com
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; and save. Afterwards refresh the VM&#8217;s DNS cache by typing <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> in a command line window.</p>

<p>(Do this for each virtual host you added in VHX.)</p>

<p>Voila! Now you should be able to access the custom virtual hosts you created in VHX on your PC using that wonderful browser we all love, Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3>Recap</h3>

<p>So here&#8217;s what we did, in a nutshell:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/download.html">Download and launch MAMP</a></li>
<li>Change default ports MAMP uses</li>
<li><a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">Download and launch VirtualHostX</a></li>
<li>Backup settings (using VHX&#8217;s startup guide)</li>
<li>Add the virtual hosts we want to use</li>
<li>Restart Apache</li>
<li>Add any virtual hosts we created in VHX to the PC hosts file</li>
<li>Rock on!</li>
</ol>

<p>There you have it. A killer, local development platform on your Mac. Once you have everything setup, you can now install and run your choice CMS (such as <a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=sperte">ExpressionEngine</a>) right on your Mac. How cool is that?</p>

<p>Go forth and make the web a better place.</p>
