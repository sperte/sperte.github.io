	<p>Let me start off this post by ensuring you that I have, in fact, tried the notes app you use and love and think is the best and want to recommend to me. I&#8217;ve tried them all. A few I can recite, from memory: Byword, Elements, iA Writer, Quick Note, Note, Simplenote, Notational Velocity, nvAlt, Nottingham, Apple Mail, Write Room, VoodooPad, Notesy, Evernote, PlainText, OneNote, DEVONthink…</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being too ambitious, thinking I can have a simple text editor combo (desktop and mobile app) that is just the right amount of simplicity without sacrificing function. Maybe I&#8217;m naive to think that Apple&#8217;s Notes app on iOS is <em>almost</em> perfect, but would be better if it supported some form of simple organization scheme. Maybe I&#8217;m stupid to suggest that a desktop app feel like it was made for the Mac, but not weighed down with feature-bloat and mostly useless functionality.</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what, in my mind, would make for the perfect desktop and mobile combination note taking apps.</p>

<h3>Desktop</h3>

<p>On the desktop it doesn&#8217;t take much. <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> is almost there, but drives me nuts with it&#8217;s strange (to the Mac) experience conventions. One example is with the creation of a new note &#8211; why in the world can&#8217;t I create a new note with ⌘-N? Those kinds of oddities or omissions are deal-breakers for me.</p>

<p>The perfect desktop notes app would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be a single window</li>
<li>Contain a listing of notes in a sidebar (I don&#8217;t want to have to use an open dialog or the Finder to open a note)</li>
<li>Have search</li>
<li>Be completely useable with only the keyboard</li>
<li>Be light weight and quick, and feel native</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#notes">Mountain Lion&#8217;s Notes app</a> looks promising, but is limited by lack of organizational functionality. Same goes for the iOS version(s).</p>

<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>The perfect mobile notes app should be similarly focussed. <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> is near pitch-perfect here. It&#8217;s just plain text in a field. It has a simple organizational schema (via tags), is quick and light weight, and has search. It&#8217;s most glaring problem, for me, is its lack of desktop counterpart.</p>

<p>So, my ideal mobile notes app would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be just like Simplenote, but have a desktop counterpart (and an icon that hints at its function, not its brand)</li>
</ul>

<p>(As an aside, can someone tell me why it&#8217;s so hard for an iOS app to support moving of notes/files from one location on Dropbox to another?)</p>

<h3>The combination</h3>

<p>When it comes down to it, it&#8217;s the combination of <em>desktop plus mobile</em> that I can&#8217;t seem to find. I actually don&#8217;t mind <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> on the Mac (even though it&#8217;s overkill for what I want), but don&#8217;t like its iOS version(s). I like Simplenote on my iPhone, but there&#8217;s no version for Mac (and the iPad version is sort of ho-hum). I&#8217;m stuck in this no-man&#8217;s land of apps that get passable grades on one platform but flunk the other.</p>

<p>For me, a notes app combo must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be just plain text</li>
<li>Not require a title for a note</li>
<li>Have a simple organizational scheme (folders or tags, either one works)</li>
<li>Sync (without fail)</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all it takes to win me as a customer. If you want to charge me $19.99 for each app, that&#8217;s fine. If you want to charge me $45 per year, that&#8217;s fine, too. As long as you deliver on those items I listed above, you can have my money.</p>
