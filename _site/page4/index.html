		<h1><a href="/">Geek &amp; Mild by Sean Sperte</a></h1>

		  <h2 id="intro">Hello. Welcome to the weblog of Sean Sperte. I've been posting my thoughts related to design, technology, and faith here since 2005.
 <a href="/about">More info &rarr;</a></h2>

  
  <div class="post">
    <h2><a href="/entry/a_neat_subtle_archives_widget">A Neat, Subtle Archives Widget</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve removed the archives widget in favor of a <a href="/archive">dedicated page/section</a>. The widget was a fun experiment, but never really worked the way I wanted it to. I&#8217;m leaving this article up for posterity and so others can still use and adapt the widget if they so desire.</p>

<hr />

<p>You may have noticed I rearranged some elements of Geek &amp; Mild over the weekend. Or maybe you didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The biggest change is the location of the archives widget timeline thing, which I moved to the opposite side of the window. The reasoning has to do with <a href="http://particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/">Fitt&#8217;s law</a> and the widget sharing vicinity with the browser scrollbar. I was never comfortable with how close the two interface elements were.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still unsure if the widget works for its purpose, but since I haven&#8217;t gotten any particularly negative feedback about it, I figure it must do its job adequately.</p>

<p>The widget itself &#8211; the code, I mean &#8211; is so simple I thought I&#8217;d share it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/creative_liberties_in_the_new_world">Creative Liberties in the New World</a></h2>
    <p>I highly respect Alex Payne, and always enjoy reading his posts. <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">His thoughts on the iPad</a>, though, don&#8217;t make sense to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this: if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I’d never be a programmer today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His argument is that Apple doesn&#8217;t leave room for tinkerers to tinker. Perhaps Payne is ignorantly dismissing the jailbreaking community in his observations, so I&#8217;ll give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>He clarified his comments in a &#8216;postscript&#8217;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my remark about not learning to program if I had an iPad wasn’t intended to be a blanket statement about <em>any</em> child not learning to program on the device. There are plenty of kids out there who are way smarter and more motivated than I was in my formative years, and I’m sure they’ll tinker no matter what obstacles are put in their way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">Exactly</a>.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s, for the sake of argument, pretend Apple has created a fully closed system that cannot be tinkered with, hacked or modified. If I&#8217;m understanding Payne&#8217;s point, in order to progress the digital age, Apple must open the system up to tinkering. His premise is, as he puts it, that the &#8216;hacker culture&#8217; has propelled the digital economy.</p>

<p>I disagree, respectfully.</p>

<p>This notion that a computing experience devoid of barriers is better for everyone is shortsighted. Barriers may be limiting to us computer nerds, but to everyone else they provide security. Additionally, it&#8217;s the barriers that serve as a challenge to tinkers, hackers and would-be developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point: true freedom &#8211; the kind of freedom that provides a platform for creativity &#8211; only comes from a place of security. Look at the US Constitution to find this model. In order to protect our liberties, we have Defenses to maintain our borders.</p>

<p>I think the opposite of Payne &#8211; that its the walled garden that will propel the digital economy. The limitations imposed by Apple in its system are both liberating (for consumers) and challenging (for geeks). (How&#8217;s that for a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5458690/the-problem-with-the-apple-ipad">dichotomy</a>?)</p>

<p>(And, for the record, in this dichotomy, we geeks are more important, not <a href="http://releasecandidateone.com/203:nothings_ever_black_white">less important</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I can&#8217;t not link to <a href="http://joehewitt.com/post/ipad/">Joe Hewitt&#8217;s post about the subject</a>. This is what he says (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Apple&#8217;s closed platform] gives me, as a developer, <em>a sense of power and potency and creativity like no other</em>. It makes the software market feel wide open again, like no one&#8217;s hegemony is <em>safe</em>. How anyone can feel underwhelmed by that is beyond me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think that those who are underwhelmed are focusing on iPad 1.0, and just need to sit tight and wait for the platform to grow up a little bit. They&#8217;ll come around.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/getting_intimate_with_the_ipad">Getting Intimate With the iPad</a></h2>
    <p>Today someone asked me if the iPad was a &#8216;tablet computer&#8217;. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to respond, so I fumbled a response that sounded something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uh, not really, but yeah. It&#8217;s a larger version of the iPhone, which is more a smartphone than a computer &#8211; but it&#8217;s also a replacement for a laptop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which got me thinking: At what point does this &#8216;magical&#8217; device challenge the definition of computing? There&#8217;s no denying the iPad&#8217;s potential to revolutionize media (once again), especially in the books and video categories. It&#8217;s also no secret Apple is pushing the idea that the iPad can replace a laptop for many people.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m curious about is how the iPad, if it earns large-scale adoption, could shift our perception of computing as an experience, which, historically, has only been defined by desktop PCs and laptops &#8211; or, portable PCs.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs used a term that captures this idea during his keynote, when he sat down in the leather chair and picked up the iPad to demo it. He said the experience was &#8216;intimate&#8217;.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m getting at is that I don&#8217;t think the iPad is just another portable device that fills a gap. Even contrary to the way it was introduced, I don&#8217;t think the iPad fits the in-between-smartphone-and-PC moniker. I think it&#8217;s much more. I think it <em>is</em> the new PC &#8211; in its infancy.</p>

<p>You could argue that the iPad is just a larger version of the iPhone, but you might be proving my point. Look at how the iPhone has revolutionized the mobile smartphone arena. The changes we&#8217;ve seen haven&#8217;t just been technological, they&#8217;ve been physiological, social, and even cultural. What if the iPad does the same for computing? What if, in three years, we look back at PCs the way we do now at the Motorola RAZR or Palm Treo (devices that, while still technologically capable, have experiences that are laughable compared to the iPhone&#8217;s)?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just saying.</p>

<p>Update: John Gruber also <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/27/cbc-interview">used the &#8216;intimate&#8217; term in his interview on CBC&#8217;s Spark radio show</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/bar_tending">Bar Tending</a></h2>
    <p>Today I <a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/6772570127">posted a screenshot</a> of my menubar via Twitter, noting how ridiculous I thought it was getting. Grant Blakeman said it best in <a href="http://twitter.com/gblakeman/status/6773054680">his reply</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the top-right of the osx menu is the bastard step-child of window&#8217;s task-bar. i often won&#8217;t use a program if there is no hide option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also noted in a followup response that developers have gotten into a bad habit of assuming their app deserves (or requires) ubiquitous accessibility. I agree.</p>

<p>Later, I audited my menubar and revised it:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/menubar.jpg" alt="My menubar" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>From left to right: <a href="http://droplr.com">Droplr</a>, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, VPN (built-in), Battery status, Wi-Fi, date and clock, Accounts (built-in), and Spotlight.</p>

<p>(Worth noting: this is my work computer. My personal laptop doesn&#8217;t include the VPN or Accounts icons.)</p>

<p>I removed the <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> icon because, while I like the subtle notifications it provides, there&#8217;s no (supported) way to remove the Dock icon, so the menubar icon was repetitive.</p>

<p>I removed the <a href="http://tapbots.com/pastebot/#sync">Pastebot Sync</a> icon because, well, it&#8217;s not really necessary. In my real-world tests, Pastebot has worked flawlessly, without the need for access to the Preference Pane.</p>

<p>I quit <a href="http://www.expandrive.com/mac">ExpanDrive</a> and removed it from Login Items because I haven&#8217;t been using it lately. If and when I need it, I can launch the app.</p>

<p>I removed the MobileMe Sync icon because I rarely need to manually initialize a synchronization operation.</p>

<p>I removed the Sound icon because I have access to audio controls on my keyboard.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I got quite a few replies with screenshots to my tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3Yz5B">Chris Merritt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3Zq2v">Matt Heerema</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3ZB76">Jesse J. Anderson</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/3ZWdi">Brian Warren</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drp.ly/4034U">Sean Gaffney</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And I thought <em>my</em> menubar was bad.</p>

    <p>I gave a talk at Northwest University today about what we&#8217;re doing at <a href="http://thecity.org">the church</a> to embrace the internet and new media technology. Here&#8217;s the slide deck:</p>

<p>It went well! I was surprisingly calm, and was able to get through the entirety of my presentation with time for questions at the end. Of course, it helped that the subject matter was something I am passionate about and could ramble on about for hours.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/creating_a_powerpoint_splash_screen">Creating a PowerPoint Splash Screen</a></h2>
    <p>Today I recorded my screen as I created a PowerPoint splash screen (or title screen) for a message series by our youth pastor. This is the sort of project I do regularly at <a href="http://thecity.org">The City Church</a> &#8211; especially for Generation Church.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to both document and share the video:</p>

<p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7444265&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7444265&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="560" height="315" /></object></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll notice a short pause after I launch Safari &#8211; it was inexplicably unresponsive.</li>
<li>I use a lot of shortcuts &#8211; especially in Photoshop &#8211; from muscle-memory. I apologize if it&#8217;s hard to follow at times.</li>
<li>I use a technique for building the title layer in order to treat it which keeps the &#8220;build&#8221; still available for editing &#8211; hence the hidden folder layer in the final document.</li>
<li>I was surprised how quick and easy it was to find a perfect (free) font for the project. I expected to have to cut out a portion of the video while I searched for the right font. </li>

    <p>As is being <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/09/10/iphone-os-3-1-now-enforces-exchange-encryption-policy-may-block/">reported at The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a>, iPhone 3G (and first-generation) owners can no longer get their Exchange email, contacts, or calendars after upgrading to iPhone OS 3.1 if their IT departments have &#8220;require device encryption&#8221; enabled on the Exchange Server. Apple posted a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2941">Knowledge Base article</a> acknowledging the issue, and recommending only that the requirement be disabled at the server-side.</p>

<p>The error users see reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>Policy Requirement</h4>
  
  <p>The account &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; requires encryption which is not supported on this iPhone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would imagine there are tens of thousands of people whom this affects.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://thecity.org">The City Church</a>, our IT department enforces strict security policies, so we have &#8220;require device encryption&#8221; enabled. Our employees who have iPhone models prior to the iPhone 3GS now have only two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not upgrade iPhone OS software</li>
<li>Buy the iPhone 3GS</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully, we caught this issue early &#8211; after two of our staff members reported issues after upgrading to OS 3.1 &#8211; and are now recommending everyone with an iPhone 3G ignore the upgrade notices they get from iTunes.</p>

<p>Our two unfortunate staff members who already upgraded took their iPhones to the local Apple Store Genius Bar. After several unsuccessfully attempts to downgrade iPhone back to OS 3.0, the Genius(es) finally gave up and just swapped out their phones.</p>

<p>With how widespread this issue could be, it&#8217;s probably in Apple&#8217;s best interest to come up with a better solution than swapping out upgraded iPhones.</p>

<h3>A Masquerade</h3>

<p>The issue here is not that iPhone 3.1 now (correctly) enforces the server requirement. Apple fixed a security hole and is further advancing iPhone software security. The problem is iPhone OS previously worked with servers that required device encryption, even when the hardware did not support it.</p>

<p>I did some investigative work (if you can call using Google &#8220;investigation&#8221;) and was able to find old versions of the iPhone Enterprise Deployment Guide. Prior to the current, third edition, the guide did not include a reference to device encryption. Incidentally, I don&#8217;t remember hardware encryption ever being promoted or advertised as a feature of the iPhone, prior to the 3GS.</p>

<p>However, one of the reasons our IT department gave the green light to the iPhone is because it had been tested (for two months) with Exchange, with device encryption required &#8211; and it had worked. You&#8217;d forgive any IT administrator if, after such a test, they&#8217;d assume device encryption was working and supported.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know how device encryption is enforced by Exchange Server, but if the iPhone was able to masquerade as a device having encryption, one has to wonder how secure the requirement really is.</p>

<p>Also in question is whether Apple knowingly allowed the requirement to work despite the iPhone&#8217;s inability to meet it.</p>

<h3>What Now?</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, iPhone 3G owners who wish to access their Exchange email now have only two options, and most will just choose to forego upgrading software. That can&#8217;t be what Apple wants. They&#8217;d prefer people either stay up-to-date, with the latest OS software and security fixes, or &#8211; and this has to be the best solution for all parties involved &#8211; upgrade to the iPhone 3GS.</p>

<p>So how can Apple get current iPhone 3G owners &#8211; specifically those who access Exchange Server &#8211; to upgrade?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve thought a lot about this and it seems to me the best way is to provide some sort of discounted price to those eligible. The way to do this is to require a user (1) upgrade their iPhone 3G to OS 3.1, (2) bring it in to an Apple Genius and (3) show they are attempting to access an Exchange Server with device encryption required. It&#8217;s a potentially nightmarish scenario logistically, but at least Apple could avoid a similar nightmare in PR.</p>

<p>But there is another solution here that might be better for everyone: Apple&#8217;s recommendation from the KB article. Allow me to digress for a moment.</p>

<p>Since we know that device encryption can be masked at the handheld level, does it even make sense to require it? Logic would suggest yes: it still does make sense, because the honest (those who own the device before it falls into the wrong hands) have no reason to circumvent the requirement. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. As we&#8217;re sure to witness, those with the knowledge that their device is not encrypting their data will continue to access Exchange Servers that require encryption &#8211; using iPhone OS 3.0. To the average user, availability is more important than accessibility.</p>

<p>This leads me to the question: what exactly is device encryption? And, more importantly, why should the average user care enough to voluntarily give up their privileges?</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t know the answer to those questions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just glad I have an iPhone 3GS.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/fontexplorer_x_pro_and_snow_leopard">FontExplorer X Pro and Snow Leopard</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> Monotype Imaging has <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/fontexplorer_x_pro_updated_to_work_with_snow_leopard/">updated FontExplorer X Pro</a> to work with Snow Leopard now.</p>

<p>There are some incompatibilities with the current release of <a href="http://www.fontexplorerx.com/">FontExplorer X Pro</a> and Snow Leopard. I wish I had time to research and accurately document all of them; I don&#8217;t. However, I know of at least two reproducible ones:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The &#8220;Clean System Font Folders&#8221; function attempts to disable protected fonts (<a href="http://twitter.com/sperte/status/3609273528">as previously reported</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Fonts activated by FontExplorer X Pro which are not located in one of the default system font folders will not be available to the system-wide Fonts panel after a restart or re-login</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A simple workaround for the second item is to launch FontExplorer X Pro, deactivate, then reactivate the fonts you want to be available to the Fonts panel.</p>

<p>I emailed Linotype about these issues and received a reply promising a new version of FontExplorer X Pro soon. To the question about whether or not the above workaround is the best way to &#8216;get by&#8217; right now, they said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our development department is trying to solve all compatibility issues as soon as possible and update a new version of FontExplorer X Pro. Please use this workaround until we fix this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No release date or additional details about the update were given. So, I guess we just wait.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/creating_a_make_title_case_service_in_snow_leopard">Creating a "Make Title Case" Service in Snow Leopard</a></h2>
    <p>Inspired by the Services overview on the <a href="http://www.macosxautomation.com/">Mac OS X Automation website</a> (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/27/macosx-automation">via John Gruber</a>), I decided to take a crack at creating my own system-wide service for converting text to title case &#8211; utilizing, of course, John Gruber&#8217;s TitleCase script.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a programmer, and the little programming knowledge I do have is strictly front-end web development, so the thought of setting up a Service like this, where I can easily convert text to title case, was very appealing. Even more appealing was the fact that I could easily show how anyone could do this.</p>

<h3>What you need</h3>

<p>First, here&#8217;s what you need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Snow Leopard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case">John&#8217;s TitleCase.pl script</a> (use option-click in Safari to download, or right-click and &#8220;Save as&#8230;&#8221;)</li>
<li>About five minutes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating the Service</h3>

<p>The Mac OS X Automation website has a <a href="http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/learn/tut01/index.html">tutorial on how to create a Service in Snow Leopard</a>, but you really only need to skim the photos to understand the process. Apple&#8217;s made it easier than saving 15% on your car insurance.</p>

<p>After downloading the TitleCase script, launch Automator. Choose &#8216;Service&#8217; in the template manager, and you&#8217;ll be presented with an Automator workflow creator window.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/automator-snowleopard.jpg" alt="automator-snowleopard.jpg" border="0" width="585" height="248" /></p>

<p>Leave &#8220;text&#8221; and &#8220;any application&#8221; selected in the building pane, but check the &#8220;Replaces selected text&#8221; box.</p>

<p>Now search the actions library for &#8220;script&#8221;, and then drag the &#8220;Run Shell Script&#8221; action to the workflow pane. It should be the last item in the search results.</p>

<p>Now, open the TitleCase.pl script in a text editor (Text Edit works just fine), and copy the entire script.</p>

<p>Back in Automator, select &#8220;/usr/bin/perl&#8221; in the Run Shell Script action; in the &#8216;shell&#8217; drop down menu. Select the entire sample <code>print</code> script that shows up, and delete it. Now paste the TitleCase.pl script.</p>

<p>Save (File &gt; Save), title, and enjoy! Your new Service will be saved in the &#8220;Text&#8221; category of the Keyboard Shortcuts Preference Pane. From there you can assign a global keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: John points to a <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/code/titlecase/">new version of his script by Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>, which, he says, is &#8216;better in every way&#8217;. (Thanks to Jordan Yee for the tip in the comments below.)</p>
