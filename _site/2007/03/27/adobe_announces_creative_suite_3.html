	<p><img src="/assets/img/cs3-productgrid_20070327.jpg" border="0" height="233" width="300" alt="Adobe's CS3 Product Grid" class="imgright" />Today <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/">Adobe announced Creative Suite 3</a>. The accompanying product matrix makes even Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Vista version grid look simple. It&#8217;s a mess to sort out, even for a veteran Adobe user.</p>

<p>Visiting the product page I thought to myself, &#8220;it would be nice if they offered some sort of &#8216;select the products you use/need and we&#8217;ll show you which package to buy&#8217; feature.&#8221; Further exploration revealed a handy <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/?cs3Tabs=cs3products">Product Selector applet</a> (Flash, of course) that seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, as soon as it was done pre-loading I realized it fell short; offering <em>areas</em> of design, rather than specific products for use.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cs3-questionnaire.jpg" border="0" height="293" width="557" alt="Adobe's CS3 Product Finder applet" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I think, Adobe, it&#8217;s safe to assume the majority of your consumers know which products they need already.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I attempted to fill out the &#8220;questionnaire&#8221; anyway &#8211; curious what product package would be recommended for my somewhat unique requirements. Here&#8217;s what I checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Graphic design&#8221; &#8211; since I design graphics</li>
<li>&#8220;Print publishing&#8221; &#8211; since sometimes I design graphics for print</li>
<li>&#8220;Illustration&#8221; &#8211; since this probably collates to Illustrator, and I need that for certain projects (including logo design, grey-box layouts, etc.)</li>
<li>&#8220;Web/interactive design&#8221; &#8211; since that&#8217;s what I do</li>
<li>Not &#8220;Web development&#8221; &#8211; since I don&#8217;t need an Adobe product to write code</li>
<li>&#8220;User interface design&#8221; &#8211; since that, too, is what I do</li>
<li>&#8220;Mobile development&#8221; &#8211; since Mobile is the new New</li>
<li>&#8220;Photography&#8221; &#8211; since I take photos</li>
<li>&#8220;Image editing and compositing&#8221; &#8211; since that&#8217;s what, uh, Photoshop is for</li>
<li>&#8220;Motion graphics / visual effects&#8221; &#8211; since on occasion I create motion graphic menus and intros for various video projects</li>
<li>&#8220;Interactive / multimedia&#8221; &#8211; since, as I said, sometimes I delve into video graphics</li>
</ul>

<p>What was suggested? Of course! The mamma-jamma Master Collection, retailing for $2,500, with an upgrade cost for me (with my CS2 Standard license) of $1,999.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at what I&#8217;d get with the Master Collection &#8230; no, better yet, let&#8217;s look at what I <em>don&#8217;t need, but would still get</em> with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe InDesign CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional</li>
<li>Adobe Dreamweaver CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Fireworks CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Contribute CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Premier Pro CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Soundbooth CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Encore CS3</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230; not to mention the various &#8220;shared features&#8221; I don&#8217;t use or need, such as Version Cue, Device Central, Acrobat Connect, Dynamic Link, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll just upgrade Photoshop.</p>
