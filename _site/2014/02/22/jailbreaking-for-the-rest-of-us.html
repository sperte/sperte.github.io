	<p>[Article originally <a href="https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/8cbda12cdff7">posted to Medium</a>]</p>

<p>I’ll keep this introduction short and sweet. The reason I’m writing this is I’ve discovered enough benefit from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">jailbreaking iOS</a> that I risk whatever crazy repercussions might come, but have noticed many of my colleagues haven’t. And I think it’s just because they haven’t ever seen an example of how to do it right. So this is as much to show off as it is to inform.</p>

<p>Demystifying jailbreaking Before going any further, I want to make sure you have a basic understanding of what it means to jailbreak your iDevice. As with most things on the internet, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding jailbreaking, so here are some key facts to know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Jailbreaking is <strong>legal</strong><br />
In contrast to what the name would imply, when you jailbreak your device you aren’t breaking any laws—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#Legal_status">at least in the U.S.</a> (What’s not legal is pirating apps or cracking DRM.) There are many who say that if you jailbreak your device it voids the warranty, and that may be true, but if you ever get to the point where the warranty needs to be exercised, it’s easy to revert your device to a default state. (Disclaimer: I’m not a legal expert and cannot give legal counsel or advice.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jailbreaking is <strong>safe</strong><br />
If you jailbreak your device and find it to be too unstable or that you don’t like the result, it’s easy to revert to a previous state. Provided, of course, that you’ve performed a backup prior to jailbreaking and can restore the backup. But, in any case, you can always restore iOS to its default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jailbreaking is <strong>easy</strong><br />
The hacker/developers—or whatever they call themselves—who do these jailbreak ‘exploits’ (more on that next) have really done a good job making the process easy. The current, most popular jailbreak technique literally requires you (a) download a desktop app, (b) plug in your iPhone, and (c) click a button.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-jailbreaking">What is jailbreaking?</h2>

<p>No two ways around it: when you jailbreak your device, you’re punching holes in an otherwise pretty structured system (“Designed by Apple in California”). Jailbreaking is exploiting weaknesses in iOS in order to gain root access and control the system. What that means is: you’re more likely to experience quirks, bugs, and crashes—and it’s at your own risk. Apple’s position on the matter could be classified as passive aggressive tolerance-to-a-point. Still, jailbreaking is pretty benign from a “breaking the rules” standpoint, and, in many ways, very important to Apple’s ecosystem. (Many jailbreak developers have been hired by Apple, for example.)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-jailbreak">How to jailbreak</h2>

<p>As of this writing, the easiest and best way to jailbreak your iDevice is using the <a href="http://evasi0n.com/">evasi0n iOS 7 jailbreak</a>. Aaaaand there it is. Before we’ve even begun, we’re introduced to one particularly strange element of the jailbreak community: naming convention. Why in the world a zero must be used in place of a perfectly good ‘O’, I have no idea. But get used to it. We’re now in the world of numbers instead of vowels, unconventional abbreviations, strange acronyms, and NoSpacesBetweenWords.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, jailbreaking using evasi0n (ugh) is as simple as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download and launch the app</li>
  <li>Plug in your iPhone</li>
  <li>Hit the ‘Jailbreak’ button</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*l-wcLhytrR8uGwIlsjmj_g.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If there does happen to be extra steps involved, they’re likely related to temporarily disabling your password lock or upgrading/downgrading versions of iOS, and evasi0n will walk you through them.</p>

<p><em>Speaking of iOS versions, a brief (and important) word of warning: make sure to check jailbreaking news sources before updating to new versions of iOS. It’s a constant game of cat and mouse Apple and the jailbreaking community play, and many times it takes a couple months before jailbreakers find ways around iOS patches.</em></p>

<p>The process usually takes a good 5-10 minutes, and afterwards leaves your device in pretty much the exact same condition—save for one new app, the soul of the jailbreak universe: Cydia.</p>

<h2 id="the-not-so-wonderful-world-of-cydia">The [not-so] wonderful world of Cydia</h2>

<p>Now that we’re jailbroken and have Cydia, we can begin installing apps and tweaks. Yes, tweaks. As in, “I love this phone, mostly, but just wish I could tweak this one feature.”</p>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/451/1*X57VeduSVtExv92eqNGy6A.png" alt="" />
<em>Cydia’s main screen—we’re not in Kansas anymore, Toto</em></p>

<p>This is where the fun starts. Actually, no. This is where it gets really hairy.</p>

<p>Before I show you what jailbreak apps and tweaks I use, I need to share the most important rule for downloading stuff with Cydia.</p>

<p>Right now if you download an app from the App Store, it’s like you’re walking in to a Best Buy. There’s a selection of stuff from various sources, but it’s all been curated and vetted. Conversely, when you launch Cydia, it’s more like visiting a flea market, where anyone who wants to can come, set up shop, and sell their wares. Because of this, you can’t always trust the original source. There’s no app approval process or gatekeeper making sure what’s available is safe, working, or relevant.</p>

<p>What this means is there is just a ton of crap out there, and no real good way of finding the good stuff. With that in mind, can you guess what the most important rule for jailbreaking is? <strong>Don’t trust the label</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead find trusted sources (outside Cydia’s interface) to vet apps, tweaks, repos, and developers, before you try them. (This article is a trusted source, just FYI.)</p>

<p>One source I turn to for jailbreak news is <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak/">iDownloadBlog</a>. They have good coverage of the latest tweaks, and provide a layer of quality control that helps me know what’s worth looking at. Additionally, both <a href="http://9to5mac.com/">9to5Mac</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/jailbreak">Lifehacker</a> cover jailbreak news occasionally, when something of note pops up.</p>

<p>Okay, <em>now</em> we can get to the fun stuff…</p>

<h2 id="how-i-jailbreak">How I jailbreak</h2>

<p>I believe the iPhone is the best mobile device in the world. I simply love it. But it’s not perfect, which is why I like to jailbreak. However, I’m very cautious about it. I apply one of my professional idioms to my jailbreaking habits: just because you can doesn’t mean you should.</p>

<p>At first, installing apps and tweaks from Cydia feels foreign. The process begins with a full-screen window that resembles a terminal that outputs the downloading, unpackaging, and installing of the app or tweak—verbosely. Afterward, if required, Cydia will require you to ‘respring’ your device, which basically just restarts iOS (without a full device reboot).</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are the apps or tweaks I have currently installed:</p>

<h3 id="multiiconmover">MultiIconMover+</h3>

<p>This tweak allows you to move multiple app icons between SpringBoard (that’s your homescreen, where all your apps live) at once. It’s a huge time saver for those who obsessively organize and re-organize their apps, like me.</p>

<h3 id="noslowanimations">NoSlowAnimations</h3>

<p><em>A demonstration of the NoSlowAnimations jailbreak tweak—just look how much faster my iPhone feels!</em></p>

<p>As the name implies—which is the case with many of these tweaks—NoSlowAnimations speeds up the animation speeds in iOS. The end effect is drastic: a huge perceptual performance increase.</p>

<h3 id="open-in-app-for-photos">Open In App for Photos</h3>

<p>One huge omission in the stock Photos app is the ability to open a photo in another app straight from your library. It’s so bizarre that friends I’ve told haven’t believed me, and have to see it for themselves. This simple tweak fixes that by adding a simple “Open In…” button.</p>

<h3 id="showcase-and-swipeselectionpro">ShowCase and SwipeSelectionPro</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/a9sFoUewc4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>A demonstration of the ShowCase and SwipeSelectionPro jailbreak tweaks</em></p>

<p>ShowCase is a great solution to <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/424345205303943168">ShiftGate</a>, where, on the iOS 7 keyboard, the shift button has never looked right. It makes the letter characters on the keys show their case (a la Android phones).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, SwipeSelectionPro gives you the ability to quickly change the cursor position while typing by swiping left or right on the keyboard. It’s tricky to get used to, but sublime to use once you do.</p>

<h3 id="activator">Activator</h3>

<p>Keep Uncle Ben’s advice in mind when using this one—with great power comes great responsibility. Activator allows you to map just about any kind of action, gesture, or activity to any function. For instance, I was able to swap the double-press of Home and swipe-up-from-bottom; so now I can get to the app switcher by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, and activate Control Center by double-pressing Home.</p>

<h3 id="couria">Couria</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ndVRzdqChrc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>A demonstration of Couria, a quick-reply tweak for Messages</em></p>

<p>Couria adds quick reply and compose mechanisms to messaging apps—mostly notably, Messages. Previously I used a separate app called BiteSMS for this, but Couria is a new and promising alternative that feels more focused and polished.</p>

<h3 id="ncallonly-and-ncsingletapclear">NCAllOnly and NCSingleTapClear</h3>

<p>A hilariously worthless element of the iOS 7 experience is the “Missed” tab in Notification Center. And, for me, the “Today” tab is similarly superfluous. NCAllOnly allows you to hide one or both of those tabs.</p>

<p>NCSingleTapClear addresses another irritation I have with Notification Center: those tiny dismiss buttons in the notification group headers. It makes it so you only have to tap the ‘X’ once to dismiss notifications.</p>

<h3 id="ccclockopentoalarm">CCClockOpenToAlarm</h3>

<p>The introduction of quick-launch functions in iOS 7’s Control Center is awesome. Not as awesome is the fact that every time you launch the Clock app, it opens in the Timer tab—regardless of <em>whether or not you ever use the timer and only ever launch the clock app for one reason and that is to set your alarm</em>. Anyway, CCClockOpenToAlarm fixes that issue.</p>

<h3 id="switchspring">SwitchSpring</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aCOQpJzvCuU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>Quitting all background apps with SwitchSpring</em></p>

<p>SwitchSpring is a handy little tweak that makes it easy to quit all active, background apps with a single swipe-and-tap. (It also makes it easy to ‘respring’ your device.)</p>

<h3 id="bonus-ayeris-theme">Bonus: ayeris theme</h3>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1024/1*MrD76wRudQqodGI3QulS-Q.jpeg" alt="" />
<em>The Photos icon from the ayeris theme—photo credit: <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/02/21/ayeris/">iDownloadBlog</a></em></p>

<p>I’m not usually big on theming the interface of iOS. For the most part I prefer to keep things pretty stock—funny, I know, considering I’m writing about jailbreaking. But I’ve made a very special exception in the case of <a href="http://www.surenix.me/ayeris">ayeris</a>, a beautifully designed theme from known designer Thientam Bach (Apple, if you’re listening, hire this guy).</p>

<p>Where most themers overdesign their themes, Bach shows restraint. His design reveals an understanding of iOS, but still introduces new (and, I think, more appropriate) aesthetics. In his words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design is not always about changing things just to say it’s different, that’s easy. The hardest part is to take something that is already good, and make it better, with a different approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you decide to download ayeris, it’ll also install Winterboard as part of its list of dependencies. Don’t worry: that’s the theming engine that most themes run on top of; making it possible for themers to easily apply their designs to various elements of the UI.</p>

<p>The cost of jailbreaking Speaking of ayeris, one thing I haven’t yet mentioned is that not every app/tweak (or theme) available through Cydia is free. In fact, many of the ones I listed above aren’t.</p>

<p>To pay for jailbreak apps you’ll need to use either a Google or Facebook account to verify your identity, and either an Amazon or PayPal account to process the payment. (I use Facebook and PayPal.) The process is simple enough, but does take quite a bit more—in terms of taps—than with the App Store.</p>

<p>If you decide to try jailbreaking your iDevice, I can offer you no better advice than this: don’t go overboard. iOS is already awesome, and while certain jailbreak apps/tweaks can make it awesomer, don’t allow the near-limitless options to steal from the simple and pure experience Apple designed for you.</p>
