		<h2><a href="/entry/my_thoughts_and_reactions_to_the_macworld_2008_keynote">My Thoughts and Reactions to the Macworld 2008 Keynote</a></h2>
		<p>The biggest surprise from this year&#8217;s Macworld Keynote was that there were no surprises. It&#8217;s actually quite a conundrum we have here. On the one hand, we all love to hear rumors, predictions and so-called leaked information from Cupertino; but on the other, we love being surprised by announcements we didn&#8217;t see coming. I wonder, sometimes, if part of the latter love stems from a passive, sinister desire to see people proven wrong. Nevertheless, the lid on Apple HQ has been compromised as of late.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m still impressed with how well Steve Jobs presents &#8211; even when we know what&#8217;s coming. If the company is to out-live the man, they must find someone to replace the man, not the position.</p>

<p>But this article is about the products, not Steve.</p>

<h3>Time Capsule</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote">Time Capsule looks to be the best product no one will buy</span>. The idea is right, I just think it lacks the simplistic appeal that it needs. The concept behind Time Machine is making the inherently inconvenient and difficult seem easy (and even fun). Look no further than Time Machine&#8217;s quirky interface to see how Apple is trying to appeal to the average consumer.</p>

<p>But Time Capsule doesn&#8217;t appeal to the average consumer. The people who spend $300 to $500 on a backup solution are already passed &#8220;easy&#8221;. They&#8217;re the guys who&#8217;ve setup scheduled backups and drive redundancy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll sell plenty of units. I just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re sell them to Average Joe; at least not at $300 each.</p>

<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong, though. I can&#8217;t stress enough how important backing up is. If Apple gets my mom to backup, praise the Lord!</p>

<h3>iPhone and iPod Touch software updates</h3>

<p>The iPhone software update had a bunch of new mini-features that probably all deserve some sort of attention and review, but the one that I was most excited about was multiple-recipient SMS.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that sad?</p>

<p>It took 5 months for Apple to finally address this. I literally had a &#8220;what am I thinking?&#8221; moment yesterday as I realized every other mobile phone on the market, from freebies to smartphones, could do what I was so excited I could finally do. Now if we could just get MMS on the thing &#8230;</p>

<p>As for the iPod Touch update, my father in-law had the best response: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have to pay for software updates for my iPod Touch! Where do I swipe?&#8221; Agreed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s $20. It&#8217;s worth it. Get over it.</p>

<h3>iTunes Movie Rentals and the Apple TV</h3>

<p>I have little to say about the iTunes Movie Rentals and Apple TV announcements; though they&#8217;re arguably the highlight of this year&#8217;s keynote. When Apple first introduced TV shows, <a href="http://seansperte.com/index.php/entry/one_more_thing_or_three_or_four/">I knew it was too early</a>. When movies came out, it still felt early. Now? Well, I think we might be getting there.</p>

<p>My wife and I haven&#8217;t rented a movie in months, but we will now. And I&#8217;ve wanted to want an Apple TV since it was introduced last year, but just couldn&#8217;t. Now, though &#8230; ? Maybe so.</p>

<p>Both items are awesome. I anticipate both succeeding.</p>

<h3>MacBook Air</h3>

<p>Two years ago when I said <a href="http://seansperte.com/index.php/entry/why_apple_missed_the_niche/">Apple had missed a niche market</a> by introducing the MacBook, I had in mind a sub-notebook for the professional, mobile user &#8211; someone like me, who prefers to work outside the office. On the surface the MacBook Air looks like it fits that niche.</p>

<p>The product tagline is &#8220;Thinnovation&#8221;, and how fitting it is. Still, with no intention of demeaning the genius engineers who worked on it, I will say this: It appears more innovation was put into making the MacBook Air thin than anything else. In fact, except for the thinness, the dimensions of the MacBook Air hardly reflect &#8220;sub-notebook&#8221; standards. (The thick bezel around the 13.3-inch display doesn&#8217;t help the illusion, either.)</p>

<p>But then again, maybe the MacBook Air isn&#8217;t meant to be a sub-notebook. Actually, I didn&#8217;t hear or see one reference of &#8220;sub-notebook&#8221; during the keynote &#8211; everything was &#8220;thin notebook&#8221;.</p>

<p>So did Apple miss the niche again? Maybe.</p>

<p>When Steve Jobs introduced the MacBook Air, he heralded Apple&#8217;s refusal to compromise in several areas: thinness, display size, keyboard size, and processor speed. While they succeeded in delivering on all of those areas, the processor speed is most certainly a compromise. The MacBook Air peaks at a 1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, nearly half a configurable MacBook Pro. Think about that. <em>Half</em> the speed.</p>

<p>Another head-tilting decision Apple made with the MacBook Air is the hard drive capacity. Why not offer a 160GB model? After all, what is a MacBook Air owner to do with all the TV shows they download from the iTunes Store after they view them? They can&#8217;t burn them to a CD or DVD! I, for example, can&#8217;t even fit my iPhoto library on my 80GB internal PowerBook hard drive. I keep it on an external firewire drive. How would I manage a library this size on a MacBook Air?</p>

<p>More criticism for the MacBook Air abounds; most of which is just typical industry feedback and nearsightedness. Some, though, has validity: the MacBook Air&#8217;s memory capacity, lack of swappable battery, lack of ethernet port, and lack of FireWire ports. What was that you were saying about not compromising, Steve?</p>

<p>The fact is, Apple did compromise on the MacBook Air. It would be impossible not to. Laptops and consumer electronics are all about compromise. The trick is finding the right tension in the <em>manufacturing</em> side versus the <em>consumer</em> side of compromise. Remember, consumers have to make compromises, too.</p>

<p>The 12-inch PowerBook G4 seemed to break the rules, though. It shared all the major features of its big brothers, the 15- and 17-inch models; but it still had smaller dimensions. The compromises were minimal: no back-lit keyboard, less USB ports, no native DVI port. I guess I sort of expected a resurrected 12-inch PowerBook G4. Instead, the MacBook Air feels like a dumbed- albeit slimmed-down version of the MacBook &#8230; last year&#8217;s MacBook.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m torn when it comes to the MacBook Air. It&#8217;s like buying shoes that will be too tight: if you can pull it off, not harm yourself while wearing them, and still get your job done, then do it. Just be sure you bring along a shoe-horn (aka USB hub).</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/interface_depth_of_field">Interface Depth of Field</a></h2>
		<p>All this attention put into so-called usability and OS developers still aren&#8217;t taking advantage of depth of field. Why not, instead of changing colors, borders, and shadows, use a blur technique for inactive windows? It&#8217;s already built into Mac OS (ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Image" title="Core Image definition in Wikipedia">Core Image</a>) so why not utilize it? I&#8217;m not a developer, so maybe I&#8217;m missing something.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interfacedof.jpg" alt="Interface depth of field example" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have to be much. In the example above I used a value of 0.5 (of Photoshop&#8217;s &#8220;Gaussian Blur&#8221; effect) &#8211; and it&#8217;s almost too much. The effect is visually appealing as eye-candy, yes, but is also useful in determining focus more immediately. Of course, it could even be provided as a user preference, allowing for greater or lesser blur for inactive windows. It could even be applied to the desktop and its icons.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re on the subject of the desktop, another question: Why not allow for a user to evoke Expos√©&#8217;s &#8220;Desktop&#8221; state when clicking on [an unoccupied spot on] the desktop? (App idea?)</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/iphone_update_september_07">iPhone Update, September ‚Äô07</a></h2>
		<p>Apple&#8217;s released what they&#8217;re calling the &#8220;September &#8216;07&#8221; update to the iPhone software. Included in the update is the iTunes WiFi Music Store, and the option to set a home-button, double-tap, to a function.</p>

<p>There are obvious speed and performance enhancements (especially with the SMS application launching), and perhaps some bug and security fixes, but I&#8217;m really disappointed there is little attention paid to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0718_glaring_omis.php">glaring omissions</a>&#8221; or <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/iphone_software_quirks">quirks</a>. For instance, there&#8217;s still no way to send an SMS message to multiple recipients.</p>

<p>Some of my other observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>New calculator icon matches the iPod Touch&#8217;s. Yuck.</li>
<li>Hooray for double-tap spacebar to add &#8220;.&#8221;.</li>
<li>SMS app is faster to launch, but still slow.</li>
<li>Camera still <a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/07/19/the-iphone-camera-problem-green-photos-how-to-fix-more-pictures/">loves green</a>.</li>
<li>Marker Felt is still used in MobileNotes.</li>
<li>Haven&#8217;t been able to connect to the iTunes WiFi Music Store yet. It keeps giving me an error: &#8220;Could not connect to iTunes Store&#8221;</li>
<li>How come <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/">this page</a> isn&#8217;t linked to from apple.com/iphone? (I got to it by manually trying &#8220;apple.com/iphone/wifistore&#8221;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the update feels more solid than 1.0.2, but lacks the new features/apps I was expecting. I mean, I sort of assumed the 4th row on the home screen would be filled, rather than having the iTunes Store icon just sort of sticking out there (they could have at least put it on the left). I guess it&#8217;s only a point update, so I shouldn&#8217;t have set my expectations so high.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/09/27/apple-releases-iphone-1-1-1-update/">MacRumors.com</a> has a comprehensive list of the new features:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store</li>
  <li><strong>Louder speakerphone and receiver volume</strong></li>
  <li>Home Button double-click shortcut to phone favorites or music controls</li>
  <li>Space bar double-tap shortcut to intelligently insert period and space</li>
  <li><strong>Mail attachments are viewable in portrait and landscape</strong></li>
  <li>Stocks and cities in Stocks and Weather can be re-ordered</li>
  <li>Apple Bluetooth Headset battery status in the Status Bar</li>
  <li>Support for TV Out</li>
  <li>Preference to turn off EDGE/GPRS when roaming internationally</li>
  <li>New Passcode lock time intervals</li>
  <li>Adjustable alert volume</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I bolded those items which were probably <em>highly</em> requested. Notice I didn&#8217;t bold much.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/spam_free_email_redux">Spam Free Email Redux</a></h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.masugadesign.com">Ryan Masuga</a> emailed me with a great question about my spam-free email setup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if I wanted to change my private email address a couple months down the line [&#8230;] what would happen to any mailboxes I made for the private1234@ address?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have a good answer for him since I don&#8217;t store my email in boxes or the inbox; instead, I use <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Merlin Mann&#8217;s Inbox Zero</a> methodology, plus a folder in my home directory where I save all archived emails.</p>

<p>Ryan did some research and found his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found that reducing the number of folders I have made things pretty easy, but isn&#8217;t really necessary either. All you need to do is ftp into your site to be able to see the &#8216;home/&#123;youracct&#125;/mail/&#123;yourdomain&#125;/&#8217; directory (I think&#8230;) and within that directory are your mail accounts. Copy mailboxes (I&#8217;m on Apache) from old private email directory to the new private email directory and voila - you&#8217;ve just moved all the mailboxes. You could probably scp these as well, but I&#8217;m not that technically savvy and just copying via Transmit seemed to work OK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy enough &#8211; if you have access to your server mail directories.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/one_of_a_kind">One of a Kind</a></h2>
		<p>I posted a satire &#8220;translation from PR-speak&#8221; article tonight, but couldn&#8217;t sleep knowing I&#8217;d just mocked one of the greatest letters I&#8217;d ever read. I had referenced the letter Steve Jobs wrote to all the early customers of the iPhone, and attempted to humanize his words even more than they already were &#8211; which in of itself proved quite difficult. I couldn&#8217;t sleep on it though, and removed the post just minutes ago.</p>

<p>After laying in bed thinking about it, I realized how unique the really letter was. First, that a CEO of any company would write with such candor and humility is amazing. Jobs has done it before, with his thoughts on DRM, but this was different. He was apologizing; and not privately, but in front of the whole world.</p>

<p>What made the letter even more special was the offer that accompanied it. Consider the statement he made during the music event on Wednesday, that Apple is on track to sell their one-millionth iPhone this month. Now consider multiplying that number by 100. Let&#8217;s just say, for example, that Apple will be giving away 600,000 store credits in the amount of $100 each. That&#8217;s $60M worth of &#8220;sorry&#8221;, and plenty of &#8220;we owe you one&#8221;.</p>

<p>Think about that. What other company has ever come close to voluntarily giving that kind of money back to its customers? Apple truly is one of a kind.</p>

<p>(By the way, I&#8217;d just like to mention that I wrote this entire post on my iPhone.)</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/its_apple_after_all">It&#8217;s Apple, After All</a></h2>
		<p>Some random stories of why Apple is still great, and why the momentary questioning of said greatness I had yesterday was premature at best:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had a friend bring his older iBook to me last week. The hard drive had died and I wasn&#8217;t able to recover it or any of the data. The machine was out of warranty, he told me, but I suggested he take it to the local Apple Store and get their opinion.</p>

<p>When he showed up the Genius recognized him from church and told him they&#8217;d take care of it. Turns out the machine was just a few weeks past its Apple Care coverage expiration, and the Genius was able to &#8220;work something out&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>A co-worker brought his iPod nano to me &#8211; it had a broken screen, and looked like it&#8217;d been sat on. The co-worker swore he didn&#8217;t drop it or sit on it, so I (again) suggested he take it to Apple.</p>

<p>He returned the next day with a smile on his face. Apple had replaced the nano, no questions asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Shea, who lives in Vancouver, Canada, visited Seattle last week and bought an iPhone at a local Apple Store. Yesterday he was &#8211; ahem &#8211; <em>surprised</em> to find out the iPhone&#8217;s price had dropped. Since he was still within the 14 day period, he only needed to return and buy back the iPhone for a $200 credit &#8230; but he lives 4 hours away.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://twitter.com/mezzoblue/statuses/251160812">he Twittered</a>: &#8220;Hi, Apple Store Seattle? Can&#8217;t make it back in, I can haz refund?&#8221; &#8220;Sure, over the phone we can get you back $200&#8221;. &#8220;Yay!&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that we&#8217;ve got all that nasty &#8220;does Apple really care about us, or do they just want to make money?&#8221; garbage out of the way, let&#8217;s get back to those awesome product announcements from yesterday &#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/im_just_a_loyal_user_so_ignore_me">I&#8217;m Just a Loyal User, So Ignore Me</a></h2>
		<p>Infatuation is a scary thing. It can drive passion, but it can also impair judgement. In the case of Apple, Inc., it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;ve become more infatuated with their products and business plan than with their users.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m writing this in an admitted state of frustration and confusion at Apple&#8217;s recent decision to drop the price of the iPhone. It&#8217;s not the price-drop itself that I&#8217;m frustrated with, it&#8217;s the timing. It&#8217;s easy for some early adopters to justify the $200 premium we paid, most got theirs on day-one. For those of us who waited a month to six weeks to make the plunge, we just paid an extra 30% for 30 days of iPhone ownership.</p>

<p>If the AT&amp;T rep had told me on July 30th &#8211; the day I got my iPhone &#8211; I could pay $399 on September 4th, or pay an extra $5.50 per day for the next 36 days to have it then, I wouldn&#8217;t have blinked before saying I&#8217;d wait. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t think the iPhone is worth $599 (and thanks, John, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#wed-05-moritz">for the reminder of how supply and demand works</a>), it&#8217;s that Apple doesn&#8217;t think it is; they just told us so today.</p>

<p>So was the iPhone priced too high to begin with? Sure, maybe. But almost half a million people didn&#8217;t think so, and bought the thing despite having never used (or even touched) one. In doing so, those brave people validated all the hype that led up to the iPhone launch; which, ironically, has now enabled Apple to more aggressively price it.</p>

<p>What Apple should do is reward the early adopters. It wouldn&#8217;t take much; something as simple as an iPhone software update that includes the top 5 requests they&#8217;ve received. Heck, I would&#8217;ve even taken a shout out at the media event today. It would&#8217;ve been nice to hear: &#8220;Thank you, by the way, to those who purchased the iPhone prior to today. It&#8217;s because of you that we&#8217;re able to offer it to the rest of the world for this price.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who knows. Maybe Apple does have some plan to make it up to us. I hope they don&#8217;t think the ability to buy music over WiFi is it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A day later, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/">Steve&#8217;s made amends</a>. Told you it wouldn&#8217;t take much.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/2007_fantasy_draft_results">2007 Fantasy Draft Results</a></h2>
		<p>Here&#8217;s my draft results from last night. I play in an <abbr title="Independent Defensive Players">IDP</abbr> league with two starting QB&#8217;s (read: deep), and had the third pick. I had a couple of really dumb selections, but overall I&#8217;m satisfied with my team &#8211; especially considering our league&#8217;s unique scoring and roster settings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Peyton Manning (3)</li>
<li>Tony Romo (18)</li>
<li>Laurence Maroney (23)</li>
<li>TJ Housh (38)</li>
<li>Marion Barber (43)</li>
<li>Santonio Holmes (58)</li>
<li>Alex Smith (63)</li>
<li>DJ Hackett (78)</li>
<li>Charles Woodson (83)</li>
<li>Ray Lewis (98)</li>
<li>Devin Hester (103)</li>
<li>Adalius Thomas (118)</li>
<li>Dre&#8217; Bly (123)</li>
<li>Michael Turner (138)</li>
<li>Najeh Davenport (143)</li>
<li>Isaac Bruce (158)</li>
<li>DeAngelo Hall (163)</li>
<li>Damon Huard (178)</li>
<li>Heath Miller (183)</li>
<li>Shaun Phillips (198)</li>
<li>Bart Scott (203)</li>
<li>Matt Stover (218)</li>
</ol>

<p>My 8th round pick is <em>obviously</em> a reach, but I&#8217;ve got a good feeling about DJ this year. I also got a lot of flack for the Santonio Holmes and Charles Woodson picks. Whatever. All the guys had their noses in their dated fantasy magazines while I was busy looking up live and accurate-to-our-league stats on my laptop. One guy (and I won&#8217;t name names) even drafted Corey Dillon (retired), Jared Allen (suspended), and Darrent Williams (dead).</p>

<p>The pick I regret most is the 15th round, Najeh Davenport. In fact, I&#8217;ve already dropped him in favor of Antwaan Randle El.</p>

<p>And I know your asking yourself, &#8220;why&#8217;d he draft 4 QB&#8217;s?&#8221; Good question. Let&#8217;s just say, it was intentional.~</p>

		<p><img src="/assets/img/iphone1.jpg" border="0" height="188" width="250" alt="My iPhone (macro shot)" class="imgright" />It&#8217;s not what the iPhone does, it&#8217;s how it does it; or how <em>you</em> do it <em>using</em> the iPhone. That fact, though stated in nearly every review of the iPhone, is hard to understand without personal experience. After three weeks of owning one of these revolutionary devices, I think I&#8217;m finally starting to get it. The iPhone is a joy to <em>use</em>. (Since when have you been able to say that about anything you own?)</p>

<h3>First impressions</h3>

<p>My first impressions of the iPhone came with a trunk-full of technical knowledge of how the device behaves. I&#8217;ll freely admit that before buying it I&#8217;d watched the 20-minute walkthrough video, read the manual, and scoured the web for every comprehensive review I could find. I was, for all intents and purposes, obsessed with it.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">What I didn&#8217;t expect was how good the iPhone actually felt in my hand</span>. The moment I was able to hold an iPhone (not connected to a security cable) was the moment I realized &#8211; <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/iphone_software_quirks/">despite the obvious drawbacks</a> &#8211; I had to own one. It&#8217;s the perfect size and weight; not too heavy, but enough so that you know to handle it with care.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the screen. It goes without saying, but the iPhone&#8217;s screen is the best on a personal electronic device, period. It&#8217;s clear, bright, and big. Actually, I happen to think that most of the physical appeal of the iPhone can be attributed to the screen itself, and not the form-factor, industrial design or Apple logo on the back. It&#8217;s just another cool-looking device &#8230; until the screen is activated.</p>

<h3>The keyboard</h3>

<p>The on-screen, software keyboard takes getting used to, but I got used to it in only a few hours. According to the type test I just took, I average about 45 words per minute (with some errors). I doubt I ever got that fast on my BlackBerry, even though I know I was faster on it than my Treo 650.</p>

<p>Even still, I would love to see a few minor modifications done to the keyboard:</p>

<ol>
<li>A &#8220;double-space for period&#8221; option</li>
<li>Clearer (or easier) way to deny the auto-completion/correct suggestion (the &#8220;x&#8221; is sometimes hard to hit)</li>
<li>More congruent auto-capitalization support</li>
</ol>

<p>Either one-handed or two, the keyboard is a hit with me. Way to go, Apple.</p>

<h3>A smartphone that syncs?</h3>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true. The iPhone does a great job of synchronizing data. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t sync To-Do&#8217;s or Notes. It seems to be public opinion that Apple will eventually build in support for those, but as of now, Notes are basically useless (why even include it?), and you&#8217;ll have to come up with another way of <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr>&#8216;ing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not had any problems syncing my data or media (800+ songs, 1000+ photos, and 10+ videos/movies worth), but I do wish I wasn&#8217;t handcuffed to iTunes to do so. And speaking of being handcuffed, why do I have to use the USB cable every time I want to update my calendar or contacts? It seems to me that data synchronization could easily be done via Bluetooth or over-the-air using .Mac.</p>

<h3>It makes calls!</h3>

<p>According to Steve Jobs, the killer app is supposed to be making calls. Since I&#8217;m not a heavy phone user, it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether or not that&#8217;s the case. The phone app is really well thought out, though, and hasn&#8217;t disappointed at all.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/iphone2.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="188" alt="An active call on the iPhone" class="imgleft" />Incoming calls take over the screen (no matter which app you&#8217;re in, or what you&#8217;re doing). The display shows the caller&#8217;s name or number (depending on whether or not you have them in your contacts list), their picture (again, depending on their contact status), and a two buttons; for answering or ignoring the call. Once in an active call, the on-screen controls for placing the call on hold, making another call, looking up a number, entering a number, or placing the phone in speaker-phone mode are big, bold, and clear. You can even return to the home screen and activate another app while still on the call.</p>

<p>Making a call is very simple, but does feel like it takes a few more steps than it should. First, you launch the phone app, then navigate to the desired screen for either Favorites, Recents, Contact List, or the traditional numeric keypad, then tap the name or enter the number. If you select a name in the Contact List, you must also then tap the desired phone number for that person. If I had a greater need to make regular calls, I would probably find the process frustrating, but since I&#8217;m just a casual caller it works fine.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T&#8217;s signal is mediocre; not great, not horrible. I&#8217;ve dropped three calls so far (two the first day). In most areas of Redmond and Bellevue, Washington, I get full signal. Frequently, though, the signal will suddenly drop to zero for 2&#8211;3 seconds, then pop back up to full. As for data, speeds on EDGE are <em>just</em> bearable. I just tested (with full signal strength) and got 149.5kbps. I must be getting the &#8220;updated&#8221; EDGE speeds, though, because I don&#8217;t find it as slow as some claim it to be.</p>

<h3>Lightning round</h3>

<p>In no particular order, here are some additional notes I&#8217;ve been compiling, but don&#8217;t really need to elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos look absolutely gorgeous. I start my demos with them; especially because the &#8220;pinch&#8221; effect always gets an &#8220;ooh&#8221;.</li>
<li>The camera confuses me &#8230; why such a nice camera, with crummy pictures, and barely any functionality?</li>
<li>MobileMail can&#8217;t save pictures?!</li>
<li>Standby screen is only semi-useless; it shows the latest, unread text message, clock, and date.</li>
<li>Weather is awesome (check out the additional info via &#8220;Y!&#8221; link). Stocks are cool. Where&#8217;s the &#8220;Scores&#8221; app?</li>
<li>Battery life is good, but I still have to charge nightly.</li>
<li>iPod is absolutely beautiful &#8211; the best part, in fact. The muting feature rocks!</li>
<li>Wish I could directly subscribe to and download podcasts.</li>
<li>Scrubbing long podcasts without chapters is just about impossible &#8211; but at least the fast forward is good. It gives audible feedback as the track forwards.</li>
<li>The apps feel somewhat disjointed (in terms of interface), and part of me wonders if Apple didn&#8217;t open up the iPhone for third-party development for that very reason &#8211; no real base for an SDK if there are no real standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The big picture</h3>

<p>What Apple&#8217;s done with the iPhone can&#8217;t be described as anything short of amazing. Nay-sayers who nitpick every quirk and omission are just haters, link-baiting and glamorizing the few negatives. If you take a step back and look at the overall satisfaction among iPhone owners, you cannot deny its success.</p>

<p>I absolutely love my iPhone, and wouldn&#8217;t go back to a &#8220;regular&#8221; mobile phone if you paid me.</p>
