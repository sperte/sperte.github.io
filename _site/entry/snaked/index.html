	<h2>Snaked</h2>
	<p>By way of a simple warning, let me just say that if you think you&#8217;re hot stuff on Mario Kart DS and find yourself wanting to try the online gameplay, <em>don&#8217;t</em> &#8211; at least not until you&#8217;ve mastered the art of &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=203nqmV8OX">snaking</a>&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just learned this the hard way. 
Apparently a strategy of the elite MK&#8217;ers is to use a power-slide technique that gives a quick boost, and to do so over and over again on courses that allow (those that don&#8217;t have drop-offs or narrow curves). I know this technique, but haven&#8217;t quite mastered pulling it off the way these guys do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.n-philes.com/forums/showthread.php?t=22049">There&#8217;s plenty of debate</a> over this so-called &#8220;skill&#8221;, with arguments both for and against it. One thought is that since it&#8217;s part of the game, and not a glitch, learning it is part of advancing your skill, and what separates you from being a beginner. The other opinion is that <span class="pullquote">it alienates newcomers and robs from the spirit of the game</span>. I&#8217;ll go ahead and say that I subscribe to the latter argument &#8211; as I am completely frustrated with the technique being used against me during my first online race.</p>

<p>If I sound bitter it&#8217;s because I am. After all, I&#8217;m not half-bad! :)</p>

<p>I look at it this way: The game was designed to be used with certain &#8220;items&#8221; that, used in conjunction with dynamic driving, should make for a fun and somewhat fair competition. Using the snaking technique completely eliminates the need for items &#8211; as most snakers don&#8217;t even use their L button (the one used to deploy whatever item is in reserve). Really, watching the tutorial videos of snaking, and observing what I did just now in my online race, I cannot see how that could be fun after a week.</p>

<p>But it is just a game, after all, and while I&#8217;d love to continue ranting about it I&#8217;ve got some snaking practice to get in.</p>
