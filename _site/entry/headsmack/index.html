	<p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s humanly possible to go your entire life without having one of those &#8220;doh!&#8221; moments. You know, the ones where you wish you had a time machine and could go back in time to right before you said that stupid thing, or wrote that stupid sentence, or tripped while running to first base on a base-on-balls? Sure, there are some who experience these times in lesser frequency than the rest of us, but it still happens to them &#8230; right?</p>

<p>I bring this up only because even though I recognize this fact, I still live in an ongoing attempt to avoid such moments, yet have recently (seemingly) failed miserably. Whether I&#8217;m just being hard on myself or I am, indeed, becoming a walking, talking nincompoop is uncertain. (I&#8217;ll leave that judgement up to my wife and the rest of the world.)</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">Let&#8217;s just say that if I had that time machine, I&#8217;d be putting some miles on it right about now.</span> 
I&#8217;ll not go into detail (mostly because I still value what dignity I have left), but I will say that as a husband, this year I&#8217;ve basically used up the alloted <em>grace period</em> automatically given to my gender upon marriage &#8230; for a lifetime. Sure, I didn&#8217;t forget the anniversary &#8211; date &#8211; but did I <em>plan</em> anything for it? No. And of course I didn&#8217;t forget her birthday &#8211; it&#8217;s the day after mine &#8211; but did I get her anything? No. <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<p>At work you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d do better, and judging from the outside you could say I&#8217;ve been pretty successful this year: I launched two new websites (<a href="http://www.generationchurch.org">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thecity.org">2</a>), a top-ranked video podcast, and have advanced the media of the church by leaps and bounds. But life at work hasn&#8217;t been all strawberries and cream. My mouth (or fingers, I should say) have landed me in trouble a couple of times, and I&#8217;ve had to apologize, clarify, straighten out and fix more than ever. <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<p>One of those &#8220;doh!&#8221; moments even came today as I was working on a redesign of this site. I happened upon several of my older entries and read them again. Ugh. Do you ever read what you wrote and just hate it? Honestly, if it weren&#8217;t for my commitment to keeping the past in pure form, I&#8217;d go back and rewrite half the entries on this blog! <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<h3>It&#8217;s not that bad</h3>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not having some sort of a masochistic rant-fest here. It&#8217;s not all that bad, and I&#8217;m sure some of you have better (or worse) stories to illustrate the Headsmack Effect even better than I. I&#8217;m really not too tripped up when a &#8220;doh!&#8221; moment happens, and I usually am able to laugh at myself &#8230;</p>

<p>I suppose that&#8217;s mostly because my wife picks up whatever slack I&#8217;ve created, though.</p>
