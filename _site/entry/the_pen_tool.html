	<h2>The pen tool</h2>
	<h4>05 December 2005</h4>
	<p>I&#8217;m taking an Illustrator class right now. It&#8217;s a two-day crash course that I registered for almost three month ago; I would have completely spaced it out except for I got a reminder email last week from the school. 
I&#8217;ve taken these type of crash courses before so I knew what to expect today when I arrived. The room is small, which is a nice fit for the 8 of us enrolled. They put me on a Mac mini (with a Dell monitor), which I was surprised to find was somewhat snappy during the 8-hour training. I did, of course, what any well-mannered Mac fanatic would do as soon as I hopped on the machine: Checked the specs. They had put in 1GB of RAM and outfitted the thing with an AirPort card and Bluetooth. I had to change the resolution from the standard 1024x768 &#8230; what were they thinking? It&#8217;s an <em>Illustrator</em> class!</p>

<p>The instructor is knowledgable and friendly enough, and most of my classmates are keeping up well. Since my pen tool skillz have been on permanent campout in Suckville, I&#8217;m taking some of the extra time I have during the class (after finishing the exercises in half the time allotted) to polish them up.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m learning a lot and having a good time &#8211; I&#8217;ve just used Adobe products and Photoshop&#8217;s paths so much that most of the stuff being taught (so far) is review. Most of the stuff we covered today is almost second nature to me already. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be a bit more challenged tomorrow, as we begin more complex techniques.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a flower I made for my wife when I got home:</p>

<p>It took about 90 seconds.</p>
