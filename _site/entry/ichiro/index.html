	<h2>Ichiro</h2>
	<p>After watching Ichiro play against the Mariners for the first time last night, I sat on my couch reading the reaction of Seattle sports fans on the web. I came across this piece on Tumblr: <a href="http://theartofcompetition.tumblr.com/post/27893499063/there-was-no-joy-in-the-emerald-city">There Was No Joy In The Emerald City</a>. The author says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel shorted as a baseball fan today. The game was better when Ichiro was ominously roaming the right field region at Safeco Field. It was a welcome dose of predictability in an unpredictable game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this expresses well the overall sentiment in Seattle. We&#8217;re all just sort of reeling. Happy for Ichiro? Sure. He has a much better shot at getting a championship ring now. But he was a part of Seattle culture &#8211; as much as an athlete can up here. We had Ichiro bobble-head nights at Safeco Field, local commercials with every day workers mimicking his at-bat stance, and the &#8220;ICH-EE-RO&#8221; chant. Not to mention his face and name plastered all over the city &#8211; especially at the stadium.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tumblr_m7niloN21I1qbt9u6o1_1280.jpg" alt="Ichiro bowing as a Yankee" border="0" width="600" height="374" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>It was by Ichiro&#8217;s request, I understand. That the Mariners received a couple of minor leaguer pitchers in trade underscores this: the Mariners made the decision in order to honor Ichiro. That part of the story is great, and I wish Ichiro well. I really do. I&#8217;ll be rooting for him and his new team &#8211; hopefully all the way through the World Series.</p>

<p>There were also business and internal culture reasons the Mariners made the trade. Ichiro&#8217;s salary and veteran overhead are now cleared, making way for the youngsters to step up. That part I can understand, too. That&#8217;s baseball. That&#8217;s the game.</p>

<p>The part that stings, and the part I&#8217;m so frustrated by, is that Seattle continues to be burned by our sports organizations, who, in their attempt at trying to produce winning teams, keep messing with established culture; always looking to the future. They fail to understand the external, brand impact. They&#8217;re trying to make Yankee-like decisions in a non-Yankee city.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a news flash for Northwest sports teams: your fans aren&#8217;t really fans. We&#8217;re more like casual spectators, at best. If you want to win us over &#8211; have our money &#8211; you have to appeal to our emotions.</p>

<p>This is why, when we&#8217;re winning, Seattle gets <em>really</em> into it. Winning feels good. But after the winning season(s) ends, what&#8217;s left to get emotional about? I&#8217;ll tell you what: the brand &#8211; which is best represented by the players.</p>

<p>There might be a small segment of <em>true</em> fans, season ticket holders, and die-hards who were born here and have no choice but to take pride in their local professional teams. But those segments only make up an average attendance &#8211; for the Mariners &#8211; that equals the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/attendance">fifth-worst in the league</a>. Not enough.</p>

<p>Seattle sports culture extends beyond the small amount of actual fans. It goes to the living room, coffee house, and neighborhood community, where the majority of people now can&#8217;t name a Mariners player on the roster.</p>
