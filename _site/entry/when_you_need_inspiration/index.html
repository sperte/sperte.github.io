	<p>As a creative professional (it sounds more glamorous than it is) I&#8217;m in constant need of inspiration. Normally I don&#8217;t lack in this area, as admiring the design of others usually produces just the flicker I need to get the creative flame burnin&#8217;. Such was the case with the <a href="http://www.commentsense.com">redesign</a> I just did for my wife and my site, <em>CommentSense</em>. But <span class="pullquote">what happens when the juices just don&#8217;t flow, and the creative well has run dry?</span> 
I suppose it could be as a result of the recent happenings in our country, or maybe the type of project I&#8217;ve been given; whatever it is, I&#8217;m finding myself in a completely foreign place, devoid of motivation and inspiration. Which really sucks because the project is due (yes, <em>due</em>) this weekend. Of course there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to make the deadline, but I&#8217;ve got to &#8220;give them <em>something</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without going into details, the project is simply a redesign of a website. So far I think I&#8217;m at 7 or 8 homepage mockups &#8211; none of which I love. As far as <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> I&#8217;m about as far behind as you can get (is there a negative?). I&#8217;ve been given a lot of creative liberty so you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be a blitzing tornado of ideas and design. Hardly. This is even a project I&#8217;m actually <em>passionate</em> about. Still, no matter what I do, I cannot nail even a design style.</p>

<p>So, what do you do when you need inspiration? I&#8217;m open to ideas &#8211; really. I&#8217;ve already tried my repertoire:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cssbeauty.com/">Peruse</a> <a href="http://cssvault.com/">the</a> <a href="http://cssimport.com/">designs</a> <a href="http://www.webstandardsawards.com/">of</a> <a href="http://stylegala.com/">others</a></li>
<li>Start with color</li>
<li>Start with type</li>
<li>Start with photos</li>
<li>Start with grid layout</li>
<li>Take time off/away from the computer (or project)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.commentsense.com">Do another project</a></li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Sex (I&#8217;m married, it usually works)</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230; and I&#8217;m still coming up empty.</p>
