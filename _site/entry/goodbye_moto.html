	<h2>Goodbye, Moto</h2>
	<h4>08 September 2005</h4>
	<p>Thanks for the little walk down memory lane, Mr. Motorola-exec-who-spoke-at-the-music-event, but I still don&#8217;t think Motorola has the gusto to match Apple&#8217;s wicked design style. The rest of the world is agreeing, and I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;ll get those great &#8220;<abbr title="Actual Revenus Per Unit">ARPU</abbr>&#8221; stories you&#8217;re expecting. Goodbye, Moto. 
It&#8217;s the day after, and the word on the street is: nano = good, ROKR = lame. My <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/nano_nano/">initial reaction</a> is basically the same. The long-awaited phone is falling below everyone&#8217;s expectations &#8211; even Steve&#8217;s own Keynote slide, which stated it was a quad-band GSM phone! (It&#8217;s actually a tri-band, North America GSM phone &#8211; with no 3G/EDGE capabilities.)</p>

<p>Motorola executive <del>Ed Zander</del> <ins>Ron Garriques</ins> was welcomed up on stage yesterday by Steve Jobs to make a few statements about the phone (the video stream of the event is <a href="http://stream.apple.akadns.net/">now online</a>). He gave a nice little history about how Motorola first came up with the &#8220;mobile radio&#8221; (and the crowd yawned), and bragged about how the ROKR is the coolest phone on the planet. Right. He also did a little bump-n-grind (which he says was cut short) to Gwen Stafani&#8217;s &#8220;Holla Back, Girl&#8221; playing on the phone&#8217;s stereo speakers. Thank you, Apple, for giving him an allotted time.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">The ROKR is an embarrassment to Apple</span>. Not only is it a step backwards in terms of Apple&#8217;s industrial design, the phone doesn&#8217;t even keep up with the emerging market of new 3G devices &#8211; the Sony Ericsson K750, Nokia N90 and even Motorola&#8217;s own RAZR. After handling an iPod nano today (of course I got my hands on one this soon!) I&#8217;m in embarrassed for Apple; that they&#8217;re partnered with Motorola. The nano is truly a step foward on the road of innovation, while the ROKR remains an ugly ketchup stain on Apple&#8217;s otherwise clean and tidy shirt. As a PC advocate and former Microsoft employee friend of mine suggested to me today, &#8220;it&#8217;d been better for Apple to <em>not</em> announce anything than this sub-standard phone.&#8221; He admitted to catching the Apple-fever as of late but was immediately disillusioned after checking out the ROKR&#8217;s specs yesterday after the announcement. What a shame.</p>

<p>I honestly hope Mr. <del>Zander</del> <ins>Garriques</ins> is correct, and they move millions of these units &#8211; but that&#8217;s not going to happen. The phone will sell its initial batch of luxury-buying and then, when those that bought tell their friends it sucks, and those friends tell their friends &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say people listen to people, not advertising. Based on what I&#8217;ve heard of reaction so far, the outlooks seems dismal for <del>Zander&#8217;s</del> <ins>Garriques&#8217;</ins> ARPU stories.</p>

<p>What Apple needs to do, in order to break free from this sinking sand of Motorola muck, is start developing the iTunes client for <em>numerous</em> manufacturer&#8217;s now. Samsung, Palm, Symbian, Sony Ericsson even. Get the client out there (like Real and Opera have done) and show the world they&#8217;re not &#8220;in bed&#8221; with Motorola, but rather, in the business of mobile technology innovation.</p>

<p>&#8230; that, and they need their own stinkin&#8217; iPhone!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I forgot to mention how incredibly dull the unveiling of the phone actually was during the event. Does this look like excitement on Steve&#8217;s face?</p>
