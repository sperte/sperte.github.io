	<h2><a href="/entry/dye_brasso_dye">Dye, Brasso, Dye!</a></h2>
	<p>So I bought myself (big shout-out to The Wife&trade; for the approval) an <a href="http://www.theinvisibleshield.com/ipod_nano_screen_protector.html">invisibleSHIELD</a> for my iPod nano. The demo video on their website sold me. Watch it, if you&#8217;ve got time. 
A couple of days go by and it finally came in the mail. I was expecting something more for some reason, but the package was literally just a standard-sized envelop with the shield inside. It came with a little tiny piece of paper that said to go to a specific URL for application instructions. I had already done my homework, though, so I wasn&#8217;t surprised to find out that in order to apply the shield you must use a soapy-water mixture.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2005/GearNGadgets/September2005/RDMGG_InvisibleShieldFirstLook.htm">testimony of others</a> who have done this seemed to be favorable, I decided it would be no big deal to endanger my nano for the cause. After all, I <em>am</em> protecting it, right?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s rewind for just a second, though, because earlier that day I had been reading up on all the complaints from nano owners about the scratch-prone casing. <span class="pullquote">I, for one, am among those who feel the nano scratches entirely too easily</span> &#8211; I believe mine was scratched up mostly by air particles and the hot and cold air mixture here in Seattle. It&#8217;s insane. I found one particular blog with a potential remedy to the problem: Brasso.</p>

<p>Apparently a small application of Brasso rubbed in thoroughly will remove the scratches from the screen. Wow! This guy&#8217;s story seemed legit and he has pictures too. Perfect! I thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to remove any scratches I had on my nano <em>before</em> actually putting on the invisibleSHIELD! Of course, I had The Wife&trade; double-check the guy&#8217;s blog for validity and she gave me the go ahead to buy the $4 can of Brasso. I went to work on my nano.</p>

<p>A half-hour later my pure, white iPod nano was now more of a yellowish, white nano. Granted, the scratches were all gone. Okay, so maybe I didn&#8217;t rub the Brasso out all the way &#8230; No, that wasn&#8217;t it because another half-hour later and it was still off-color. Okay, time to check the blog again. I read and reread the guy&#8217;s entry and it didn&#8217;t mention anything about discoloration. Since he had a black nano, though, it was safe to assume he didn&#8217;t notice any. I commented on his blog and kept trying to rub the Brasso off.</p>

<p>SITE NOTE: A less-than-informed commenter (not the author) on the blog happened to spew off some inappropriate words towards me claiming I was lazy and rude for commenting about my experience, hence the reason I have not linked to the entry. Feel free to Google it out, if curious.</p>

<p>I resolved to assume the best, put on the invisibleSHIELD and hope the white would somehow return, or the yellow wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought.</p>

<p>My experience putting on the shield went much like the story from the <a href="http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2005/GearNGadgets/September2005/RDMGG_InvisibleShieldFirstLook.htm">Rainy Day Magazine entry</a>. It took me three tries to get the front shield placed properly. It was really hard justifying getting soapy-water all over the front of the iPod. The back shield went on easier &#8211; either by design or because I had already learned the method of application. Drying time was 2 hours, but by then it was already midnight, so I just went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote alt">I was depressed, though, because I had a yellowish white iPod</span>, and though it was now protected, it was ugly. Why did the Brasso dye the acrylic? Should I have rubbed even longer and harder? I already felt as if I was rubbing <em>off</em> the casing. I supposed it wouldn&#8217;t matter anymore, since I would no longer have to baby it anyway because it had the shield on. I would just throw it around now, and not care about it.</p>

<p>I woke up the next morning and checked the status: Still yellowish. The shield was great though. I could barely notice it was there except for feel. Visibly, it was truly <em>invisible</em>. So, I had a protected, scratchless, yellowish iPod nano. The Wife&trade; was very sympathetic, but I wasn&#8217;t being consoled. It was a sad day &#8211; until I got to work.</p>

<p>It was about halfway through my morning when I noticed the iPod was &#8211; how should I say this? &#8211; &#8220;wigging out.&#8221; It was randomly changing tracks, rewinding and turning off and on the backlight &#8211; all without me touching the thing. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, because I thought it too. The water.</p>

<p>Great, <span class="pullquote">so now I had a protected, scratchless, yellowish, <em>disfunctional</em> iPod nano!</span></p>

<p>I called the store I bought it from and asked if they&#8217;d take it back. Of course, they said no. It was a shot in the dark. Then I thought I&#8217;d better try all the problem solving solutions that normally work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebooting. Didn&#8217;t work &#8211; it just flicked the backlight on and off again. Odd. I realized the problem was definitely hardware then. Nevertheless, I tried</li>
<li>Restoring the software. It seemed to fix the problem for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Smacking. Hey, sometimes technology needs a little jolt. I had the protector screen on it anyway, right? I smacked it, no help.</li>
<li>Can-of-air. Okay, so let&#8217;s try drying it out &#8211; if that&#8217;s really the cause of the disfunction. Again, no help.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that was the low-point. I started to consider selling the thing on eBay for parts. It was ruined already, so I removed the protective shielding to see if maybe the yellow tint would somehow come off with it. You know, it actually <em>did</em>, kind of.</p>

<p>It was at that moment I had a thought: AppleCare. Of course, AppleCare doesn&#8217;t cover customer abuse or cosmetic issues, but mine was (ahem) &#8220;wigging out.&#8221; Maybe, just maybe, they&#8217;d swap it out &#8211; or at the very least, send it in for repair. I thought I&#8217;d just try.</p>

<p>I made an appointment at the Genius Bar online and headed to my local Apple Store. On the way I prayed (yes, I pray about these things) that they&#8217;d not ask any pointed questions, and that I wouldn&#8217;t have to lie about it. I certainly wasn&#8217;t out to rip off Apple, but I did feel somewhat ripped off myself for buying a product that had scratched so easily. I rehearsed the possible scenarios in my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Best case: Easy swap-out.</li>
<li>Most likely: Send it in for repair (which wasn&#8217;t so bad since I had a shuffle that I could use in its stead).</li>
<li>Worse case: &#8220;Sorry, fella, nothing I can do about that.&#8221; After that, I was eBay-bound, for sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>I arrived and had to wait a few minutes so I compared the nano color to the display models. I was surprised to find that my nano wasn&#8217;t too much different. It just looked more used (yes, more used than the <em>display models</em>, which get handled a lot).</p>

<p>They called my name and at the bar he read my description of the problem (to himself). &#8220;So, we gotta nano that&#8217;s &#8216;wigging out,&#8217; eh?&#8221; he chuckled. I answered and handed him my nano. He played with it for a little and I narrarated the problems. &#8220;See, it doesn&#8217;t even reboot if you hold down the menu and select buttons,&#8221; I pointed out. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>What happened next totally reminded me of the scene in <em>Meet the Parents</em> where Greg is trying to get a ticket home and the lady behind the airliner desk is just pounding the keys on the keyboard, almost insanely. The guy took literally 5 minutes entering in data.</p>

<p>I finally broke down and asked, &#8220;so we gonna send it in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;ll just swap it out here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">Inside I was leaping up and down and I think I heard the Hallelujah praise chorus</span>. I had to continue the ignorant, uninformed customer facade though: &#8220;Oh, but I didn&#8217;t bring my box and stuff it came with &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the only thing we swap is the unit itself,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, okay, cool,&#8221; I said. &#8220;So do I have to pay anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope, it&#8217;s covered under the warranty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sweet! I walked out with a brand new (&#8220;replacement part&#8221;) iPod nano! Somewhere, some poor Apple technician is opening up my iPod wondering what&#8217;s wrong and is probably going to find just condensation.</p>

<p>So, the moral of the story? I don&#8217;t really know &#8211; but I haven&#8217;t taken the new iPod out of the plastic wrapping yet, and don&#8217;t plan on doing so until I can get a none-water-needing-to-appy case for it. Until then, I&#8217;ll use my shuffle.</p>
