<p><a href="http://www.shauninman.com">Shaun Inman</a> recently released a new version of his website stat-tracking software, <a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a>. The upgrade features many new improvements to the previous version, but the bulk of the full version change came in the form of speed increases, a new(ish) interface, and updated default modules (called Peppers). Oh, and it now supports IE PC &#8211; which is perhaps the reason for the influx of crazys on the Mint support forums, but I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. 
Now let me get this out of the way before I go on: Though I own licenses for Mint, and read Shaun&#8217;s blog regularly, I do not know him personally. I think we&#8217;ve had one off-site conversation over email, but that&#8217;s it. Beyond what I&#8217;ve read on his site and what others say about him, I don&#8217;t have any other point of reference with which to judge his character.</p>

<h3>If web developers were sports cars</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote">Let&#8217;s be honest. Shaun&#8217;s work is an inspiration</span>. His designs, software, and methods are all pace-setting. When he uses X and Y, we all &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aah&#8221; and start to use X and Y too. He&#8217;s like a <a href="http://www.threadless.com/submission/49956/the_Future_Pide_Piper">modern pide piper</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I remember first coming across shauninman.com when I was just discovering the Web Standards movement. I learned so much by dissecting his stylesheets and HTML. In a way, he&#8217;s sort of like a mentor to me. Shaun is like the Ferrari of web developers, and I feel like a Dodge Neon compared to him.</p>

<p>Yes, I respect him a lot.</p>

<h3>Bad breath needs Mint</h3>

<p>I guess that&#8217;s one of the reasons I take so much offense when I read <del>responses</del> <ins>knee-jerk reactions</ins> to the upgrade cost (of $19) for the new version of Mint. Enter those crazys I mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think charging customers $19 to upgrade their &#8216;Mint&#8217; software is an absolute joke, and a disgraceful demand on Shaun Inman&#8217;s behalf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to say I&rsquo;m very dissappointed. I love what Shaun does. Great design work. Excellent ideas and awesome developpement. But paying 19$ for an upgrade. I think I&rsquo;ll pass. Sorry Shaun.[sic]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] why should we have to pay for an upgrade to Mint 2? It seems a bit unfair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if Shaun were indebted to those who&#8217;ve purchase his software, and must therefore make good by supplying free support, upgrades and compliments. <em>Riiiight</em>.</p>

<p>I do understand some of the frustration these people have over an upgrade fee &#8211; I&#8217;ve questioned his decision and the cost, too &#8211; but this attitude of entitlement is what irritates me. If anyone has entitlement here it&#8217;s the guy who holds all the cards: Shaun Inman.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s remember, we&#8217;re all using <em>his</em> software. He developed it. He packaged it, and he licenses it. We&#8217;re just users of the stuff, not owners. Hence the license agreement we must agree to before installing it. He&#8217;s not Google, and can&#8217;t just give away the stuff he creates because he&#8217;s floating in a river of income. He&#8217;s a real guy with real needs, wants and feelings.</p>

<h3>Old mints still freshen</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve purchased Mint 2. I did so just last night, in fact. I wanted to track this website&#8217;s stats. Sure I could use one of the other stat-tracker titles already installed on the server, but I wanted something more streamlined and focused. I decided Mint was the perfect product for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also purchased licenses for <a href="http://www.thecity.org">The City Church</a> in the past. I won&#8217;t, however, be upgrading those &#8211; at least not for a while. I don&#8217;t need to. Mint version 1 already does everything I need it to do for those sites. <span class="pullquote">Version 2 offers some great features I&#8217;d love to have, but don&#8217;t need</span>.</p>

<p>The new iPod nanos are pretty sweet, too. Do you think if I complain to Apple that it&#8217;s unfair to charge full price for me to upgrade my first-gen nano they&#8217;ll listen and understand? Doubt it.</p>

<h3>Fresh perspective</h3>

<p>I challenge anyone who feels Mint&#8217;s upgrade price is too steep to take a good, hard look at what they&#8217;re getting for the price they&#8217;re getting it at. Do some comparisons. What can $20 get you?</p>

<ul>
<li>A car wash</li>
<li>A dozen roses</li>
<li>A meal at Red Robin</li>
<li>A pair of cheap driving gloves</li>
<li>A board game</li>
<li>A few days worth of Starbucks</li>
<li>19 songs from the iTunes Store</li>
<li>A DVD</li>
<li>A custom-made hat with your name on it from one of those vendors in the mall</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything in that list you&#8217;d be willing to give up for a software package that&#8217;s well-built, comes with free support, a wonderful development community, and actually <em>does what it says it&#8217;s supposed to do</em>?</p>

<p>I tip my hat to Shaun, and wish him the best of luck with the future of Mint (and other endeavors). That&#8217;s free of charge.</p>
