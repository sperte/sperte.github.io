	<h2>Widescreen PowerPoint</h2>
	<p>In addition to maintaining the multiple websites for <a href="http://www.thecity.org">The City Church</a>, I&#8217;m also responsible for the PowerPoint and media presentations during services. Actually, even though my experience was in web design it was for PowerPoint and graphics that I was initially hired at the church. 
But enough about me, let&#8217;s get to some interesting stuff.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been making the transition to the nearly-standard, widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio for all of our media. Our television shows have been letterboxed (16:9 in a 4:3 frame) since 2002, and most of our promos, spots and internal videos have been in native 16:9 for the past few months. I love the widescreen format. The benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s got 75% more width</li>
<li>It&#8217;s more pleasing to the eye</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the new television standard</li>
</ul>

<p>So it&#8217;s been my goal to figure out how to design and deliver widescreen <em>PowerPoint</em> (which we use for announcements, message notes, and other various presentations), making transitions to and from video seamless, and avoiding scaling or cropping.</p>

<p>The first thing I had to do was change the output of the computer&#8217;s secondary display to a (native) widescreen format. I settled on 1280x768, which isn&#8217;t exactly a 16:9 aspect ratio, but works &#8211; it was the closest setting available. In order to fill the display&#8217;s frame I use a custom page size in PowerPoint of 12.5&#8221; by 7.5&#8221;. This measurement was found by calculating the display width and slide height (<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00566.htm">as outlined here</a>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the standard &#8220;HDV&#8221; preset (in Photoshop) when designing graphics, backgrounds and images for PowerPoint. The preset creates a blank canvas that is 1280x720, 72dpi and has [close-to] standard title and action safe guides already generated. This resolution isn&#8217;t an exact match to my PowerPoint canvas aspect ratio, but it allows me to preview what the final output will be once the graphic is rescaled to the standard 16:9 ratio.</p>

<p>After the secondary display hits the processors (in my case, a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&amp;Q=&amp;is=REG&amp;O=productlist&amp;sku=404200">Folsom ImageProHD</a> for the center screen and a <a href="http://www.tvone.com/c2-5000-main.shtml">tvOne video proc</a> for the sides) I have custom aspect ratio settings of 1.5, which gives the proper 16:9 output to our projectors.</p>

<p>For the plasma monitors throughout the Kirkland Campus I have a scan converter from RGB Spectrum that downscales the PC&#8217;s output to standard definition (I know, I know) composite, which is then distributed through multiple DA&#8217;s and splitters.</p>

<p>The result is a seamless comparison between video and computer outputs. So far I&#8217;m satisfied with the results, although it&#8217;d be nice to be pumping HD video so I wouldn&#8217;t have to downscale my PC image as much.</p>
