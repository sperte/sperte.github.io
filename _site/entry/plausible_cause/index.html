	<h2>Plausible cause</h2>
	<h4>30 August 2005</h4>
	<p>The rumor mills are going nuts today with speculation about Apple&#8217;s recent stirrings: They&#8217;ve planned a &#8220;music event&#8221; for this <del>Sunday</del> <ins>Wednesday</ins>, September 7th &#8211; that, coupled with the fact that they have been working with Motorola on a mobile version of iTunes. Am I the only one who&#8217;s doubting some of the predictions these sites are churning out? 
First of all, I&#8217;ve learned to never underestimate Apple&#8217;s ability to throw a curve ball. I didn&#8217;t see the iPod (1st generation), the shuffle, iPhoto, or the move to Intel coming. They were all announced amidst rumors that I completely disregarded. I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;ve become balanced.</p>

<p>That said, I am not too young (a Mac-fan and devotee) to remember such forgotten rumors as the Mac car or the new tablet/pda (which still exists, I guess). Rumors, in general, are dangerous. The key in deciphering Apple-related gossip is to think about cause and motive. Why is it in Apple&#8217;s (current) interests to [fill in the blank]. How would they benefit? Does [fill in the blank] keep them on the same roadmap they&#8217;ve been using?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking this week as we await the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000887049175/">iTunes phone</a>, possible <a href="http://www.eet.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=169400638">iPod [mini] updates</a>, and the infamous <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=454">video iPod</a>.</p>

<h3>The iTunes phone</h3>

<p>I forget who said this, but I like it: &#8220;Think about it, Steve Jobs has a cell phone and curses the thing every time he uses it.&#8221; You know it must be true. From the crummy OS/interface, to the useless apps, to the sub-standard sync capabilities &#8230; everything about todays mobile is positively anti-Apple&#8217;s style. If Apple wants to complete their journey, giving its consumers the best experience for their digital lifestyle, the cell phone <strong>must</strong> be on the agenda.</p>

<p>So, sure, start with the music app. Why not? It&#8217;s a perfect segue from the iPod to the <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/07/all-hail-the-iphone">iPhone</a>. Choosing Motorola is obvious since A) Sony is out of the question, 2) Samsung&#8217;s OS is even worse than Motorola&#8217;s and d) the sexy RAZR phone is as close to Apple&#8217;s hardware heart as the PowerBook G4. (And yes, when Apple and Moto got into bed I&#8217;m sure the then-in-development RAZR was shown to Jobs.)</p>

<p>I believe we&#8217;ll see at least some kind of cellular convergent device introduced this weekend. Whether it&#8217;s the ROKR, the iPhone, or just the E790 with iTunes mobile. (What&#8217;s the difference? Ellifino.)</p>

<h3>The video iPod</h3>

<p>I think we&#8217;ll see it this weekend. However, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see an iPod that can play just any .mov you stick on it. I think we&#8217;ll get the ability to play whatever videos are downloadable from the iTunes Music Store (e.g. music videos, exclusives, etc.). It remains to be seen whether or not a new &#8220;section&#8221; will be launched within the store for <strong>just</strong> videos, but I think the lack of rumors surrounding this particular item denote it&#8217;ll be delayed.</p>

<p>My prediction is that the iPod upper line will be bumped to 60 and 80 GB models and support video playback of DRM&#8217;d videos from the iTunes Music Store. Look for price points starting at $499.</p>

<h3>A flash-based, color iPod mini</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d buy one. Beyond that, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest what to expect in this category. Again, however, I emphasize my learned ability to <strong>never underestimate Apple</strong>.</p>
