	<h2>It&#8217;s Apple, After All</h2>
	<h4>06 September 2007</h4>
	<p>Some random stories of why Apple is still great, and why the momentary questioning of said greatness I had yesterday was premature at best:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had a friend bring his older iBook to me last week. The hard drive had died and I wasn&#8217;t able to recover it or any of the data. The machine was out of warranty, he told me, but I suggested he take it to the local Apple Store and get their opinion.</p>

<p>When he showed up the Genius recognized him from church and told him they&#8217;d take care of it. Turns out the machine was just a few weeks past its Apple Care coverage expiration, and the Genius was able to &#8220;work something out&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>A co-worker brought his iPod nano to me &#8211; it had a broken screen, and looked like it&#8217;d been sat on. The co-worker swore he didn&#8217;t drop it or sit on it, so I (again) suggested he take it to Apple.</p>

<p>He returned the next day with a smile on his face. Apple had replaced the nano, no questions asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Shea, who lives in Vancouver, Canada, visited Seattle last week and bought an iPhone at a local Apple Store. Yesterday he was &#8211; ahem &#8211; <em>surprised</em> to find out the iPhone&#8217;s price had dropped. Since he was still within the 14 day period, he only needed to return and buy back the iPhone for a $200 credit &#8230; but he lives 4 hours away.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://twitter.com/mezzoblue/statuses/251160812">he Twittered</a>: &#8220;Hi, Apple Store Seattle? Can&#8217;t make it back in, I can haz refund?&#8221; &#8220;Sure, over the phone we can get you back $200&#8221;. &#8220;Yay!&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that we&#8217;ve got all that nasty &#8220;does Apple really care about us, or do they just want to make money?&#8221; garbage out of the way, let&#8217;s get back to those awesome product announcements from yesterday &#8230;</p>
