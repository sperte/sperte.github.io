	<h2>Productivity at its Best</h2>
	<p>The latest issue of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> has an article about <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek">working less</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>But in the larger scheme of things, does that really matter? Will we lie on our death bed and say &#8220;Damn, I wish I would&rsquo;ve got more done at work?&#8221; I doubt it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know I won&#8217;t be saying anything remotely like that on my death bed. For one, I ain&#8217;t a cusser. Secondly, I believe I <em>work to live</em>, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Ryan Carson (yes, from <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/">Carson Workshops</a> and <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/">DropSend</a>) says that productivity is not a matter of time, but mentality. He and his wife decided to do something crazy to prove it: Work only four days a week.</p>

<p>It worked.</p>

<blockquote><p>We have more peace. More time to think. More time to enjoy life. It&rsquo;s fabulous.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds good to me, but I wonder if Mondays (my current day off) are supposed to provide that for me already.</p>

<p>Ryan also gives a couple practical pointers as well; things like don&#8217;t instant message, don&#8217;t keep your email client open, ask for alone-time, and make lists.</p>

<p>I lost count of how many times I&#8217;ve read these three things lately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t instant message</li>
<li>Get alone</li>
<li>Prioritize your projects (get organized)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think Jonathan Snook put it best when he said that productivity is like a stream train that takes a lot of energy to get moving &#8230; And once it&#8217;s derailed, you&#8217;ve not lost 5 minutes, but 30.</p>
