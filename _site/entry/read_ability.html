	<h2>Read Ability</h2>
	<h4>08 June 2010</h4>
	<p>Though it wasn&#8217;t mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s WWDC keynote, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari was updated to version 5</a>, and now has a faster JavaScript engine, Bing support, and a cool new plain-text article view based on Arc90&#8217;s <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">excellent &#8216;Readability&#8217;</a>, called Reader.</p>

<p>The Arc90 team distributes the core Readability script as open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. I just happen to know about that, don&#8217;t ask me why. Which means Apple was able to integrate it into Safari with little effort and no collaboration with Arc90. In fact, <a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2010/06/07/safari-5-another-step-towards-better-reading-on-the-web/">Arc90 didn&#8217;t know Readability was being used until after Safari 5 was released</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve since discovered that Safari’s “Reader” feature is, in fact, based upon our own Readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisdary/status/15672452287">does acknowledge Arc90/Readability in Safari&#8217;s acknowledgements</a>, which is cool. It&#8217;s just funny to me that Apple didn&#8217;t even notify them.</p>

<p>So anyway, <a href="http://twitter.com/sky_balloon/status/15638642616">hypothetically</a>, if there was a beautiful iPad browser that, among other cool features, had a &#8216;Reader&#8217; view, would you want it to [continue to be developed and] be released, even if Mobile Safari will likely have said &#8216;Reader&#8217; view in the future?</p>
