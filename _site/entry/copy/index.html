	<h2>Copy</h2>
	<h4>29 May 2007</h4>
	<p>Another <del>day</del> <ins>month</ins>, another great <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> article. This one about writing effective headlines (taglines) and copy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whoneedsheadlines">Who Needs Headlines?</a></p>

<p>Speaking of writing, I noticed after completing a recent project, that I had spent the majority of time one part in particular &#8211; even though it represented a very small percentage of the visual design. The project was a redesign of our church bulletin (the handout given to attenders as they come into the building), and the part that took the longest was the &#8220;welcome&#8221; tagline, which read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to The City Church</p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;re so glad you chose to come to church today, and we hope you&#8217;ll experience God&#8217;s goodness and blessing at our services. Welcome home!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tcc-bulletin.jpg" border="0" height="388" width="639" alt="The City Church bulletin, and highlighted 'welcome' tagline" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>In that short statement, (hopefully) a lot is communicated.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, we&#8217;re partnering with the reader and celebrating their [bold] decision to come to church.</p>

<p>We understand it&#8217;s not always an easy decision to make on a Sunday morning, and there are a lot of reasons to not. The very act of church attendance is a vital step to a fruitful relationship with God, so we honor it.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we offer support in the form of an indirect invitation to <em>experience</em> something &#8211; beyond just church as usual.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s any question as to why a visitor is attending, we hope to put that to rest by communicating some simple expectations that they can adopt and share. After all, some people don&#8217;t have a clue why they show up on Sundays.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the &#8220;welcome home&#8221; statement is designed to add another layer of comfort and family-like reception.</p>

<p>I debated this statement because I didn&#8217;t want it to sound presumptuous or proud. I needed a strong conclusion, though, and nothing else seemed to fit quite the same way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first run of bulletins were handed out this past Sunday, and I&#8217;ve not yet heard how they were received; and I may never hear. Whether the copy I wrote actually made any difference to a visitor I&#8217;ll probably never know. After reading the ALA article, though, I at least feel justified in taking the extra time to make sure it was right.</p>
