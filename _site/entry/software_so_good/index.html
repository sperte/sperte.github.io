	<h2>Software So Good ...</h2>
	<p>&#8230; it makes users bend over backwards to use it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsfire-icon.jpg" border="0" height="140" width="144" alt="NewsFire icon" align="right" class="imgright" />John Gruber today <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/april#mon-16-miller">published a link</a> to a <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/04/15/product_activation_sucks">blog post written by Charles Miller</a> about <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com">NewsFire</a> and its [abnormal] activation scheme. In case you&#8217;ve not been a reader of Geek &amp; Mild for at least a year, you might need to know that I&#8217;ve had a similar experience in dealing with David Watanabe, the creator of NewsFire. 
Here&#8217;s the issue: in order to activate NewsFire you must enter the email address you used to register the software. In my (and I assume Charles&#8217;) case, a commonly-known, public email address. The address is sent and checked with a server somewhere and verified.</p>

<p>This seems like an okay licensing solution since there&#8217;s no activation key to lose, no long serial string to save (and possibly lose) and no multi-level order number and registration code process. In fact, <span class="pullquote">activation is so easy it practically encourages the procedure</span>.</p>

<p>The problem, obviously, is security. What if, say, a valid email address is published on a blog whose author is an outspoken proponent of NewsFire and an obvious valid license-holder? You can bet they&#8217;ll be problems. (As hard as it is to imagine, there <em>are</em> dishonest people in this world.)</p>

<p>Do you think that&#8217;s the fault of the email address owner?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what David thinks. In the tension-filled email conversation that followed my blog post about this subject last year, David explained that I should have used a non-public email address and that his product activation scheme is as secure as its users make it. (He had a hard time even trusting that I was the genuine owner of the email address.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, we got it worked out. It was with great humility and pent-up emotions that I agreed to delete my blog post in exchange for the use of NewsFire using a different, more private email address. To this day, I have a bad taste in my mouth because of the way I was treated as a paid customer.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was just what Charles is doing &#8211; saying good riddance by admitting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David doesn&#8217;t want me as a customer, and given how few rights standard software licences actually grant the purchaser these days, I suspect he has the right to make that decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsfire-interface.jpg" border="0" height="152" width="200" alt="NewsFire's interface" align="right" class="imgright" />I just couldn&#8217;t do that. You see, I&#8217;d tried out several alternative RSS readers (and continue to do so even now), none of which fit the bill &#8211; none like NewsFire. Whether it be a web-based solution, built-in to a browser, or a feature-laden desktop client, none compliment my lifestyle and computing habits like NewsFire.</p>

<p>In complete contrast to <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/developers_your_software_doesnt_work_unless_it_does_what_i_want/">my recent post about bad software ruining the experience</a>, NewsFire&#8217;s interface actually creates an experience wherein I willingly swallow my pride and practically beg to continue its use.</p>
