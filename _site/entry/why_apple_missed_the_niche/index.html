	<h2>Why Apple Missed The Niche</h2>
	<p>Apple missed an important demographic by introducing a consumer-level portable instead of a smaller professional portable: Me. 
I don&#8217;t dare assume I&#8217;m in the majority (of Apple consumers) by being a graphic designer and a [wannabe-]mobile-professional, but I&#8217;ll take some liberty in saying that I&#8217;m part of an influential niche market &#8211; one that&#8217;s been ignored by Apple&#8217;s recent offerings. Especially considering the very latest, the MacBook.</p>

<p>With a 13.3-inch, glossy, widescreen display, an Intel core-duo processor, and cool, showy features like the mag-safe power connector, built-in iSight camera, wireless remote, and motion sensor protector, the MacBook <em>seems</em> like a viable &#8220;upgrade&#8221; for me. I&#8217;m using a now-archaic 1.67GHz PowerBook G4, introduced not even than 18 months ago. So why does the potential upgrade feel like it would be more of a downgrade to me?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you why.</p>

<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m a professional; or at least I like to consider myself one. I design graphics and websites, and as such, use a computer as my primary tool. Technical requirements aside, <span class="pullquote alt">I demand a certain level of quality for my tool(s)</span>. The MacBook, though &#8220;designed by Apple in California&#8221;, does not meet that demand. It&#8217;s a <em>consumer</em> product, not a professional one. If feels cheaper, looks cheaper and <em>is</em> cheaper than my PowerBook.</p>

<p>Secondly, while it&#8217;s not directly the fault of Apple, the dilemma of Adobe not updating their products to run natively on the Intel processor means s-l-o-w performance from Photoshop on the MacBook (and MacBook Pro for that matter). Trust me, I know. I&#8217;ve managed to install and use Photoshop CS2 on a borrowed MacBook Pro. (That&#8217;s another story entirely.)</p>

<p>Finally, should I decide to order a MacBook, I will first have to sell my PowerBook &#8211; something I don&#8217;t want to do. Not that I&#8217;ve built some attachment to Caspain II (okay, maybe a <em>little</em> bit of sentiment), but I don&#8217;t think I could get near what it&#8217;s worth for it &#8230; to me. Similar models are getting between $1100 and $1300 on eBay; less than half what I paid for it just over a year ago.</p>

<p>So what could&#8217;ve Apple done to get me to upgrade (without hesitation)? A smaller than or 13.3-inch, ultra-portable, aluminum, backlit, duo-core, non-glossy, iSight-equipped, feature-laden, not-too-hot, no foam MacBook &#8230; called &#8220;The Macintosh ProBook&#8221;. And I suspect others in my demographic would follow me in throwing down their credit cards for something like that, too.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think the MacBook is a great product. &#8220;I Approve&trade;&#8221; it still, and will still recommend it for anyone considering. Apple nailed it when it comes to offering a near-perfect consumer portable, I doubt it not. There&#8217;s not a better laptop, PC or Mac or otherwise, in its price range or class. Bottom line: The MacBook rocks.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#8217;t rock <em>me</em>.</p>
