	<h2>2.72</h2>
	<h4>10 May 2006</h4>
	<p>Standby for a quick rant.</p>

<p>Since launching the redesign of the <a href="http://www.thecity.org">TCC site</a> I&#8217;ve been overwhelmed by the response. The site was featured on a few <a href="http://www.cssbeauty.com/archives/2006/May/the_city_church/">gallery</a> and <a href="http://godbit.com/featured/the-city-church-2">forum</a> sites, I received tons of email, got IM&#8217;s, in-person compliments, and the <a href="http://shannonblogs.com/B382442645/C1012383835/E20060510213207/index.html">obligatory mom blog post</a>. I personally feel I&#8217;m just enjoying the wake made by <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse&#8217;s</a> great design. (That&#8217;s a wakeboarding reference, for those living in the alps.)</p>

<p>I also officially &#8220;<a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/reboot/show/1106">rebooted</a>&#8221; the site, even though I was over a week late in doing so. The <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com">CSS Reboot</a> site allows for late entries, so it matters not. To my surprise, the site is getting votes, even though it appears in the middle of a long list of rebooted sites, some 10-12 pages into the system.</p>

<p>Still, the rating (as it is now) is 2.07 &#8230; out of 5. I remember reading about the ratings being harsh on another blog last week, but I had no idea it was this bad.</p>

<p>At first I thought I was just being defensive, but when I double-checked the score against the highest rated &#8211; read that again: &#8220;<em>the highest rated</em>&#8221; &#8211; site I found that the TCC site wasn&#8217;t doing too bad. The best rating, among hundreds of rebooted sites (including such greats as <a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft</a>, <a href="http://nataliejost.com/">Natalie Jost</a>, <a href="http://avalonstar.com/">Avalon Star</a>, and <a href="http://www.snook.ca/jonathan/">Jonathan Snook</a>!) is: 2.72.</p>

<p><strong>2.72</strong></p>

<p>Out of 5.</p>

<p>Out. Of. 5.</p>

<p>Is this not ridiculous to anyone else? Are those voting really being that harsh? Do these designs really suck that bad? Is there a problem with the system?!</p>

<p>So while I&#8217;m somewhat disappointed the site&#8217;s receiving a D rating on CSS Reboot, I feel a little better knowing <a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft&#8217;s amazing masterpiece</a> isn&#8217;t getting much better.</p>

<p>Not that I care about ratings. :)</p>
