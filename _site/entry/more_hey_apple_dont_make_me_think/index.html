	<h2>More &#8220;Hey Apple, Don’t Make Me Think&#8221;</h2>
	<p>Derek Powazek <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/880">is pointing out</a> an oddity found when comparing the interface of Safari on a desktop to the one found on the iPhone. Basically the order of elements in the toolbar at the top of the window is completely opposite &#8211; which forces users to take an extra few milliseconds to process.</p>

<p>Apple has to change this on the iPhone, and soon, in order to unify the two interfaces; but my guess is that they won&#8217;t because the context of the two interfaces differs so much (e.g. desktop versus handheld), and because 4-million-plus iPhones are already floating around. I also wonder how close the benefit-to-detriment ratio is. Have users already gotten used to the refresh button being located to the right of the location bar?</p>

<h3>No, seriously. Stop making me think!</h3>

<p>Stranger &#8211; and of higher priority to me &#8211; is the conflicting behavior of the multi-touch trackpad on the MacBook Air and the multi-touch display on the iPhone. On the iPhone, for example, to <em>advance</em>, you swipe from right to left. <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/us/apple/mac/macbookair/2008/apple_macbookair_swipe_20080115_r320-13cie.mov">It appears</a>, though, it&#8217;s the opposite on the MacBook Air! Oh, boy.</p>

<p>I already have a hard enough time switching between the iPhone and my PowerBook equipped with a two-finger sensitive trackpad. In MobileSafari, I swipe from bottom to top to scroll down. On the PowerBook, I do the exact opposite. The first time I accidentally used the iPhone method on my PowerBook, I actually got my hopes up, thinking my trackpad had died &#8211; after all, if that were the case, I&#8217;d be forced to upgrade to a MacBook Pro, right?</p>

<p>And I know I&#8217;m not the only one to deal with this. [Reference link forthcoming.]</p>

<p>I understand this whole multi-touch thing is a new world for Apple, and I&#8217;m willing &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; myself and my time (the seconds-worth it requires) while they work these things out. However, I do hope they understand they&#8217;re training the world to a new interface right now. I wonder, if they&#8217;d been this all-over-the-map with the iPod scroll-wheel, would it be the success it is today?</p>
