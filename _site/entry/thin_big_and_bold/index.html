	<h2>Thin, big and bold</h2>
	<p>The time has come. You may now mark your calendars &#8211; Sean has officially gone beyond a simple splash screen and launched an actual (linking, breathing?) website. Content may be lacking, but she packs a punch underneath. 
Welcome to <em>seansperte.com</em>, version 1.0. I&#8217;m writing this at 3:15am after three days of coding and tweaking (obviously, only in my free time). Wow, I&#8217;m really tired now &#8230; But not as tired as I am of those stupid &#8220;coming soon&#8221; splash screens I was previously offering.</p>

<p>This site will be my personal space to geek-out and act like a 14-year old hacker kid. I&#8217;ve already provided a few links that support this cause. Now there&#8217;s no reason for me to bog down <a href="http://www.commentsense.com">CommentSense</a> &#8211; my wife and my other blog &#8211; with senseless techno-jargon and Photoshop tutorials. I can do that all <em>right here</em> now, isn&#8217;t that great?!</p>

<p>(Speaking of geeking-out, I&#8217;m sitting here in bed with my laptop and my wife just rolled over in bed, looked at me and sighed. I just realized what I&#8217;m doing, and I&#8217;m wondering what in the heck motivates this kind of behavior.)</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ll likely provide more details about the site in later posts. Until then, though, why don&#8217;t you try out the comment form and tell me what you think. If you&#8217;ve gotta suggestion, now&#8217;s the time to share.</p>

<p><strong>Semi-important disclaimer</strong>: So far, I&#8217;ve only tested on Safari 2.0 and FireFox running Mac OS 10.4. I&#8217;ll get around to making sure it&#8217;s <em>decent</em> in IE6/PC (as in, the content can actually be seen) someday. Either that or I&#8217;ll just stick a big fat notice at the top of every page encouraging a switch to <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">FireFox</a>.</p>
