	<p><img src="/assets/img/itunes-playlists.jpg" alt="Screenshot of iTunes Playlists" border="0" width="175" height="177" class="imgright" />A proper (read as &#8220;useful&#8221;) method for rating my music &#8211; with stars, in iTunes &#8211; has eluded me ever since the feature was introduced. Here&#8217;s a new method I&#8217;m trying; which I couldn&#8217;t fit into a 140-character Tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 stars = &#8220;I could listen to this song anytime, in any mood&#8221;</li>
<li>4 stars = &#8220;I love it&#8221;</li>
<li>3 stars = &#8220;I like it&#8221;</li>
<li>2 stars = &#8220;It&#8217;s okay (but I have to be in the mood)&#8221;</li>
<li>1 stars = &#8220;Not a fan &#8230; but I keep it around for some reason&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to rate every song in my library with this system. Unrated songs will be left unchecked, and won&#8217;t play in shuffle mode or get transferred to my iPhone. I&#8217;m starting by rating entire albums, or at least those I can, confidentially.</p>

<p>Coupled with data iTunes records automatically (e.g. play count, times skipped, etc.), ratings can prove very helpful in fulfilling preference. For instance, finding songs that I love but haven&#8217;t played in a while could be as easy as creating a Smart Playlist that matches checked songs that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a rating of greater than 3 stars</li>
<li>Kind doesn&#8217;t contain &#8220;video&#8221;</li>
<li>Last Played is not in the last 3 months (a &#8220;played&#8221; song must play through entirely, I believe)</li>
<li>Last Skipped is not in the last 3 months (for a song to be &#8220;skipped&#8221; it must have played at least 1 second first)</li>
<li>Skip Count is less than 3</li>
<li>Date Added is not in the last 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>That Playlist returned just under 400 great songs I&#8217;d either forgotten about, or haven&#8217;t listened to in months! I&#8217;m rediscovering my music.</p>
