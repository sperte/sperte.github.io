	<h2>Well begun</h2>
	<p>There are probably dozens of scientific studies that show … dang, what am I even talking about? I have no idea how to write. I’m not a journalism or English major. I’m probably breaking rules already, just with this opening paragraph.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that I assume most of the science of being productive has to do with just getting started. The whole “get off the couch” thing, or “well begun is half done”, as Mary Poppins would say. Like a train leaving the station, in order for us to get anywhere, we’ve got to put a lot of effort towards that first step: from Stop to Go.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons that, as a designer/developer, I need to pay close attention into the amount of friction I put into the products I build. People already have a hard enough time learning new things. I should aim to make it as effortless as possible to “engage”.</p>

<p>It’s also the reason I’m clumsily trudging back into the world of blogging – or whatever you call this; publishing random thoughts to the web. I have no clear objective, haven’t written or sketched out a game plan, don’t know who I’m writing for, and obviously am not qualified. I’ve just … begun. Again.</p>

<p>It’s the first day of the New Year – well, it’s the evening of the first day. Whatever endeavor awaits your (whoever you are) involvement, my challenge to you is just do it.</p>
