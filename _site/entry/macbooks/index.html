	<h2>MacBooks</h2>
	<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, but Apple announced the successor to their iBook line of consumer portables on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook">the MacBook</a>. We knew this one was coming, but it&#8217;s still nice to see it happen &#8230; finally.</p>

<p>Speaking of finally, I took a break this afternoon/evening to head to my local Apple Store to get my grubby hands on one &#8211; a full DAY AND A HALF after they were announced. It felt like an eternity, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Impressions? Slick. Slick as in &#8220;not quite sexy, but still cool enough to make your PC friends drooly-jealous&#8221;. While the white variation is only slightly more cool than the original iBook, the black is exceptionally &#8220;slick&#8221;.</p>

<p>And yes, Martin. I Approve&trade;.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, I&#8217;m currently using and, in fact, writing this entry on a brand new, 2.0ghz MacBook Pro; and <em>loving</em> it. This thing really screams. Especially at the simple stuff like launching and switching apps, organizing files, surfing the web, etc.</p>

<p>So long story-short &#8211; I get to &#8220;borrow&#8221; it for 4-8 weeks while my wife&#8217;s laptop is being repaired by Fujitsu. Word to the wise: It pays to get the extended warranties on PC&#8217;s. ;)</p>

<p>Impressions, reviews and thoughts on the MBP later.</p>
