	<section id="about-me">

			<h3>it's pronounced <i>spurdy*</i></h3>
			<small>(* in ’merica, at least)</small>
			<p>It&rsquo;s French, but I&rsquo;m actually French-Irish-Jewish. I&rsquo;m 37 years-old, married, and have four children. I love my family.</p>
			<p>I was born and raised in Colorado and moved around a lot during my formative years &mdash; Florida, Georgia, Virgina &mdash; finally landing in Seattle, WA in 1998. I&rsquo;ve been here ever since.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian. My faith is important to me, but I don&rsquo;t consider myself religious.</p>

			<h3>My story</h3>
			<p>My professional career began as a teenager in 1995 with my first job designing yellow page advertisements for local businesses. Prior to that I&rsquo;d dabbled with some graphic design as a hobby and had won a few logo design competitions.</p>
			<p>For almost 12 years I helped lead digital and media productions at The City Church, where I launched several award-winning websites and campaigns, the most notable being &ldquo;JESUS IS ____&rdquo;, which was nationally recognized and inspired dozens of lookalike projects and installations.</p>
			<p>During that time I also co-founded a side company called Sky Balloon, a small app development studio. We worked on over a dozen apps and shipped five. Our most popular app (with over 300k downloads) was a quick-launch video camera called Capture, which was featured on CNN, CNET, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Wired, and dozens of smaller publications and blogs.</p>
			<p>In 2011, I left my career at the church to help start Tagboard, a social media software company. After creating the brand and product prototype, I assumed a Chief Product Officer role and helped lead a team of designers and developers to build, deliver, and manage the whole of Tagboard&rsquo;s product. Later, I transitioned to a more central role in the company as Chief of Staff, providing coaching and support for the leadership team, as well as inside counsel for the rest of the organization worldwide.</p>
