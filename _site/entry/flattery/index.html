	<h2>Flattery</h2>
	<p>It seems <a href="http://www.thecity.org/">The City Church</a> isn&#8217;t the only design being ripped off lately. Khoi Vinh, a well-known designer, had his personal blog design <del>copied</del> <ins>emulated</ins> by an architectural institution. He <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/0713_plagiarism_i.php">wrote about it</a>, admitting he was at a loss for course of action, and the comment thread that followed could literally be bound as a novel. Long story short: The designer responsible for the institution&#8217;s site apologized for misinterpreting Khoi&#8217;s copyright notice and removed the design, defaulting back to a previous one. It&#8217;s a happy ending, but the discussion is still going on Khoi&#8217;s site &#8230; <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/0713_plagiarism_i.php">do check it out</a>. (And don&#8217;t skip the comments.) 
So my thoughts immediately go to this <a href="http://www.joomlart.com/templates_club/club_portfolio/ja_regulus.html">Joomlart rip off</a> of our (or <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse&#8217;s</a>) design, which is more than a little &#8220;inspired&#8221;. We&#8217;ve clearly placed a copyright notice (including the &#8220;all rights reserved&#8221; clause) on every single page of the site, but some <em>still defend</em> the template and its designers, stating that it&#8217;s not an exact copy, and that the source code is completely different (<a href="http://forum.joomla.org/index.php/topic,76641.0.html">source</a>).</p>

<p>Now, since The City Church site has received so much attention (did you see we won two <a href="http://awards.cssmania.com/2006/07/07/css-world-awards-winners-2006.php">CSS Mania awards</a>?! Woohoo!), I anticipated having to deal with plagiarism, to some extent. In fact, I&#8217;ve even been asked if I&#8217;d email the PSD and source files to someone so they could copy the site for their own use &#8211; you know, since they were &#8220;located so far away&#8221;. Right. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;m not opposed to people taking the design and code for educational purposes</span>, but straight-up copying is cheap and (in my personal opinion) unethical.</p>

<p>I know Jesse deals with this all the time, and I&#8217;ve read other designer&#8217;s blogs as they&#8217;ve engaged in the same sort of battles, with their own designs being stolen or repurposed. My position has always stayed the same: I&#8217;m with the designers.</p>

<p>See, there&#8217;s just two sides to this issue, and two kinds of people involved:</p>

<ol>
<li>The designers or design-saavy &#8211; those that understand design to be a commodity, something valued as much (or more) than physical objects that can be traded, bought and sold.</li>
<li>The design-wannabes or genuinely ignorant &#8211; those that think design is liquid and free, something of lesser value than, say, source code. These people also attack designers personally, citing the designer&#8217;s inability to see the &#8220;big picture.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, before I go further let me clarify and say that while it&#8217;s evident the Joomlart template has been built from the ground-up, and the designers (apparently a team?) that worked on it probably worked very hard, <span class="pullquote alt">it still emulates elements of The City Church design too closely to be considered original</span>.</p>

<p>Also, what makes this case unique is the fact that our design is being redistributed and <em>sold</em>. You must be a member of the Joomlart site in order to download the template, and a membership costs $40 per year. The fact that others can download, easily install and use this template/design in about 5 minutes makes this even more sticky. How could Joomlart cleanup should they somehow see the error of their ways? They&#8217;d have to contact each member and ask them to, out of the kindness of their heart, stop using the template.</p>

<p>Ugh. This is not flattery.</p>
