	<h2>Cingular business loophole</h2>
	<p>Cingular Wireless offers special premier discounts and pricing for a number of large businesses &#8211; one of which is Apple Computers. The interesting thing is, in order to qualify for the discounts, all you need is an email account proving you&#8217;re an employee of the company. Here&#8217;s where the loophole comes in: .Mac email accounts work to prove Apple Store employment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cingular_premierdeals.jpg" width="180" height="163" alt="" class="imgright" />Today I was able to enter my own (.Mac) email account at Cingular&#8217;s homepage, qualify for the special pricing, receive the confirmation email, and access the &#8220;premier&#8221; section of their website. Apparently they offer up to 45% off handsets, though I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with the offerings. It&#8217;ll still cost you $199 for a RAZR or $449 for a Treo 650. They <em>did</em> offer the ROKR for only $149, but I restrained myself.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have the courage (or budget) to actually go through with an order, but I wonder how successful one could be using just their .Mac account. I also wonder if this is intentional on the part of Apple &#8211; as an added perk to being a member of .Mac &#8211; or an oversight. Either way, it&#8217;s one of the few unspoken benefits of being a .Mac member.</p>
