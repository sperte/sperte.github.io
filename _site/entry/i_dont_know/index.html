	<h2>I don&#8217;t know</h2>
	<p>The focus of this blog is (hopefully) pretty evident: technology and all things geek. It&#8217;s only been active for one week now, but already I must break face and write about what truly matters. 
The events surrounding Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath that is now taking place have forced me to consider my position and do what I can to help. I&#8217;m literally in shock at how devastated New Orleans is &#8211; how those people are. It takes a strong person to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and I&#8217;m doing that now: I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on down there, I don&#8217;t know how I should feel about it, and I don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard from someone who has close friends near the city (I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re refugees but, rather, live in a small city outside of New Orleans) saying that the media has sugar-coated what&#8217;s happening. If that&#8217;s the case, and <em><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002463400_katrinasuperdome01.html">this</a></em> is sugar-coated, then I&#8217;m at a loss for words. I cannot even imagine what those people are going through &#8230; and I feel terribly sorry for them.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to blame someone or something in this situation. It&#8217;s understandable. I mean, we&#8217;d like to have an explanation for our kids (and ourselves). I honestly don&#8217;t know how to explain this. I know one thing, though: God isn&#8217;t to blame, and neither is the American people. We didn&#8217;t bring this upon ourselves, as some are arguing (in the same way they did with <abbr title="September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks">9/11</abbr>). This isn&#8217;t some judgment because of <em>Mardi Gras</em> &#8211; please.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of people I&#8217;m praying for right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those refugees who heeded the call for evacuation and fled the city but now have nothing to return to and nowhere to go</li>
<li>The relief workers and military who are trying to construct some sort of peaceable order and offer aid</li>
<li>Women, children and elderly who <em>got caught</em> in the storm and (for some reason or another) couldn&#8217;t evacuate fast enough &#8211; and who are still hanging on for their lives</li>
<li>Leaders in local and federal government who are making decisions on how to handle the situation</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there are those I&#8217;m praying <em>against</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demon-inspired looters and rebels &#8211; those that are shooting at relief workers, raping women, stealing valuables and causing disorder</li>
<li>Apathetic Americans who are too caught up in their own lives and lifestyles to notice what&#8217;s taking place in their own country &#8211; God forbid anything happen to <em>them</em> and their fellow countrymen continue without so much as a second look</li>
<li>Arrogant and self-seeking church leaders who appear on television or preach from their pulpits that this natural disaster is a result of America&#8217;s sin</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond prayer, money and thoughts (written or spoken), <strong>I don&#8217;t know</strong> what else I can do.</p>
