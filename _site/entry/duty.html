	<h2>Duty</h2>
	<h4>09 March 2007</h4>
	<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be on a plane to <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">Austin</a> right now. As luck would have it, the church&#8217;s video switcher wasn&#8217;t working this morning as I attempted to give a run-down of operations to my stand-in for Sunday services. Quick and unsuccessful attempts to troubleshoot the problem led to a last-minute decision: I&#8217;m going to fly out after services, on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been anticipating going to &#8220;<a href="http://www.sxswblog.com/">Southby</a>&#8221; for months. It&#8217;s a bummer that I can&#8217;t make the entire thing, but I completely understand the decision and need for me to stay. Actually, I feel better. I was beginning to feel anxious about leaving my (weekend) duties to someone else. Even though they&#8217;re capable, the system they must run is not &#8211; another story entirely.</p>

<p>So, for those I was expecting to meet up with at SXSW &#8211; namely <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry. The Wii playing and shop-talk will have to wait until Sunday.</p>
