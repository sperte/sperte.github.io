	<p>I&#8217;m not a negative person, so don&#8217;t let the latest of my writings fool you. Still, I&#8217;ve gotta get some of this stuff off my chest and I figure my blog is a good place to do that. You don&#8217;t mind do you? 
So, as pleased with the redesign as I am, there&#8217;s still some portions of <a href="http://www.thecity.org">the new TCC site</a> that have been left undone, frustrate me, or even make me cringe. Since most of my readership here are web developers, designers, or saavy web-surfers, I thought I&#8217;d lift the rug and show the dirty underneath &#8211; as a sort of behind-the-scenes, help-me-out-if-you-can, yes-I&#8217;m-human-too thing. So, without further ado &#8230;</p>

<p>That, of the TCC redesign, which needs work:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The favicon</strong>. Please. Have you ever SEEN a dumber favicon?</li>
<li><strong>The events calendar</strong>. I&#8217;ve had it with EasyPHPCalendar. I&#8217;m ready for Google Calendar&#8217;s API already. (<strong>Update</strong>: Okay so they&#8217;ve <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html">got an API</a>, now I just need someone to write an EE module for it.)</li>
<li><strong>Event registration</strong>. I don&#8217;t think ANY of the forms validate, and they&#8217;re all horribly built. And not only do I not have the time to fix them, I&#8217;m having to <em>add</em> to the mess with new registrations going up this weekend!</li>
<li><strong>IE&#8217;s rendering of list items and, more specifically, the footer</strong>. Where do I begin with this one? Why, oh why, does IE insist on adding whitespace to list items? Try as I may, I can&#8217;t seem to get the sitemap to appear correctly in IE. Then there&#8217;s the issue of the sitemap somehow dropping off/out of the footer area. ARGH!</li>
<li><strong>The members section</strong>. I had such high hopes for this section of the site &#8230; Where did April go, by the way?</li>
<li><strong>The events calendar</strong>. Yes, again. The list on the homepage of upcoming events is powered by the same system, which sucks even more when in displayed in &#8220;list mode&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of inline images</strong>. I think the site really lacks in the &#8220;this is what our church looks and feels like&#8221; department. We need a professional photographer on staff, for sure.</li>
<li><strong>Pastor&#8217;s Perspectives blog</strong>. I really wish I could&#8217;ve made this better than it is. Sure simple is good, but to me it just looks thrown together (uh, probably because it <em>was</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Print stylesheet</strong>. This one needs work mostly because <em>it doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. Ahem.</li>
<li><strong>RSS feed(s)</strong>. Again with the <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em> stuff. My goal here would be to have one main feed with literally everything on the site &#8211; audio archives, news, volunteer opportunities, comments, etc. &#8211; listed in reverse-chronological order. I think this may require some sort of not-yet-created module for EE, though. I&#8217;d also like to have singular feeds for each database.</li>
<li><strong>Ministries&#8217; profiles</strong>. The ministries page in the about section really needs work. Honestly, each and every ministry of the church could have it&#8217;s own website, as they&#8217;re all so active, impacting and important.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice anything else that needs work?</p>
