	<h2>Southbye</h2>
	<h4>14 March 2007</h4>
	<p><img src="/assets/img/sxsw-logo2007.gif" border="0" height="159" width="180" alt="SXSW logo" class="imgright" />On Sunday night I flew into Austin, the site of SXSW, an annual film, music and interactive design festival. It was my first time attending, so I was apprehensive about it. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to go it alone &#8211; the Great Canadian, <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain</a>, and I were Southby Rookies together.</p>

<h3>The laptop culture</h3>

<p>Though it wasn&#8217;t the first thing I noticed, certainly one of the most prevalent visuals at the conference was the polarized groups of laptop users. Here were my observations of the laptop culture:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were more PC users than I expected &#8211; probably as much as 20%.</li>
<li>Two types of users: Those that put stickers on their laptops, and those that don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>If SXSW attendees are any indication, the transition to Intel-based Macs has definitely worked for Apple; everyone had a MacBook or MacBook Pro.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no place a laptop cannot be used (including the restroom).</li>
</ol>

<p>I know Austin <del>is</del> <ins>claims to be</ins> the live music capital of the world, but for me it felt more like the laptop capital. Honestly, I have never so many laptops being used in one place.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next observation: <span class="pullquote">The WiFi sucked</span> (for me). I don&#8217;t know if it was the amount of network activity, or my AirPort antenna, or what; but it seemed like most everyone had a good connection but me. I was able to get better speeds by using my BlackBerry as a bluetooth modem! Even at my hotel access was decent at best. Overall, I was disappointed in Austin&#8217;s internets.</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> was everywhere. One panel attendee commented (over the mic) that <span class="pullquote alt">Twitter was like crack</span> &#8211; her question was to Tim Ferriss (author of <a href="http://www.timferriss.com/book.php">The 4-Hour Work Week</a>), about how to &#8220;get off the crack.&#8221; Before panels began, moderators would ask that attendees switch their mobile phones to silent, turn off their laptop sound, and &#8220;keep the Tweets to a minimum.&#8221; Plasma screens, showing a <a href="http://sxsw.twitter.com/">fun presentation</a> of Twitters, donned most of the hallways.</p>

<p>You can imagine: In a world dominated by geeks, coders and artists, the mobile phone usage was at a maximum &#8230; the weird thing was, no one held their mobiles to their ear. Everyone was hunched over, frantically thumb-tapping and, I can only assume, answering the question, &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/">what are you doing?</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I hopped on the bandwagon a week prior to SXSW and learned how to take advantage of the mobile functionality. I blended right in. Jesse, on the other hand&#8211;</p>

<h3>Godbit meetup</h3>

<p>Monday night I was fortunate to meet up with a bunch of fellow members of <a href="http://www.godbit.com">Godbit</a>. It was great to put faces to names (and screen names). They were all very gracious, and although I didn&#8217;t get to personally meet everyone, the conversations I had with the few seated around me were worth the trip. I finally got to meet <a href="http://www.couchfort.net">Rob Soule</a>, and really enjoyed chatting (and playing Wii) with <a href="http://www.sporadicnonsense.com/">Shawn Grimes</a> and <a href="http://www.davidhemphill.com/">David Hemphill</a>.</p>

<p>A big thanks to <a href="http://www.artofmission.com">Ryan Heneise</a> for organizing it, and, of course, to <a href="http://www.sonspring.com">Nathan Smith</a>, the founder of Godbit.</p>

<h3>Panels</h3>

<p>Sessions at SXSW are broken up into smaller panels &#8211; each consisting of 1&ndash;5 panelists, with formats ranging from arranged presentation to open discussion. They were, I admit, hit and miss.</p>

<p>Of the panels I attended, only three really kept and held my attention, and of those, only two challenged or taught me. I don&#8217;t have attention deficit disorder, but I&#8217;m certainly spoiled, coming from a church environment where I hear dynamic preachers every week. I understand panelists are chosen for their knowledge and experience, not their ability to speak publicly, so I won&#8217;t consider complaining about the lack of presentational passion. The fact is, though, <span class="pullquote">the majority of panel content lacked for substance</span>, too.</p>

<p>I guess it&#8217;s true what they say: SXSW is about <em>networking</em>.</p>

<h3>Meeting the greats</h3>

<p>If there&#8217;s any reason to attend SXSW, it&#8217;s to rub shoulders with the cream-of-the-crop of web design and development. Among them was <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>, <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://www.simplebits.com">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>, <a href="http://www.robweychert.com/">Rob Weychert</a>, <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a>, <a href="http://www.dkeithrobinson.com/">D. Keith Robinson</a>, <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com">Greg Storey</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca/jonathan/">Jonathan Snook</a>, <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft</a>, <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com">Steve Smith</a>, <a href="http://boxofchocolates.ca/">Derek Featherstone</a> &#8230; oh my word, the list just goes on! Even <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon Hicks</a> (in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/flathicks/">some form</a>, at least) was present!</p>

<p>While I didn&#8217;t get to actually meet everyone on that list, seeing and hearing them (if they spoke in a panel) was awesome. I ran into <a href="http://www.virb.com/simmy">Ryan Sims</a> in the main hall, practically cornered him, and introduced myself (and Jesse). <span class="pullquote alt">It was as if I ran into Bono</span>. I was giddy and absolutely unaware of what I said.</p>

<p>That was Monday morning &#8211; thereafter I stopped no other web-celeb.</p>

<p>I did, though, enjoy meeting all-stars <a href="http://bw.watchtan.com/">Brian Warren</a> and <a href="http://www.markbixby.com">Mark Bixby</a> of Methodarts, and Scott Boms (<a href="http://www.wishingline.com">Wishingline</a>). Jesse and I sat directly behind them in John Gruber and Shaun Inman&#8217;s session (oh, yeah, did I mention <em>those</em> guys in the list?!) and went to lunch with them afterwards. I&#8217;ve always had great respect for Mark as a designer, and last year was bummed I couldn&#8217;t take him up on <a href="http://www.markbixby.com/blog/entry/free-starbucksreg-at-sxsw/">his offer for a free coffee</a>. It was Brian who provided the free coffee this year, and I&#8217;m really glad I didn&#8217;t miss out. They&#8217;re great guys and they even let me snap a few shots on their Nikon D80&#8217;s.</p>

<p>(Have I mentioned I&#8217;m in the market for a digital SLR?)</p>

<h3>Next time</h3>

<p>Maybe it was the sensory overload; or the stinky Austin water; or perhaps Twitter itself; but whatever the reason, I was a complete photo-taking failure on this trip! That&#8217;s unusual for me, since I&#8217;m typically the annoying one, snapping pictures mid-conversation. Next year I promise to do better.</p>

<p>Next year I&#8217;ll also try and get there on time and perhaps stay an extra day. I desperately missed my wife, though, so I&#8217;ll be sure to bring her, too.</p>

<p>Next year I&#8217;ll bring business cards. I had opted out of doing so this year because I&#8217;m really not available for hire. I missed the point, though. No one wants to hire me &#8211; they just want my contact info so they can follow my Twitter feed. Or something like that.</p>

<p>And next year I&#8217;ll be sure to bring an umbrella.</p>
