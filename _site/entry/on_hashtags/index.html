	<h2>On #hashtags</h2>
	<p>Every time I read a geek opine about social trends it reminds me of Maciej Ceglowski&#8217;s post from a few years ago entitled <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/">The Social Graph is Neither</a>. His main assertion was that we are a bunch of admittedly non-social engineers designing and building software &#8211; social networks &#8211; for a system that is so wildly complex that it cannot be graphed. What&#8217;s so entertaining to me, is not only do we attempt to design, build, and graph it, we also love to criticize it.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, when hashtags first started appearing in my Twitter timeline, I just sort of shrugged them off. I couldn&#8217;t see their value through the visual damage they imposed. Even today, I have a hard time #taking #anyone #seriously when they use more than one or two #hashtags for a #single #tweet &#8211; mostly because they just <em>look</em> bad.</p>

<p>Daniel Victor recently <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/03/hashtags-considered-harmful/">wrote about this</a>, saying he believes &#8220;a tweet free of hashtags is more pleasing to the eye, more easily consumed, and thus more likely to be retweeted (which is a proven way of growing your audience)&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s where I have to admit I have come to realize three important facts about hashtags:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hashtags are used by both users and marketers</strong>. Like it or not, you cannot deny usage of hashtags is on the rise. The most compelling thing about this is that hashtags weren&#8217;t created as a marketing tactic, yet their use has demanded marketer adoption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hashtags do have great potential</strong>. Even in their most basic form &#8211; for taxonomy &#8211; hashtags can trump inferral through machines. No one knows better what they&#8217;re saying than the person saying it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hashtags actually do increase engagement</strong>. It may be tough to recognize through subjectivity, but the reality is, hashtags provide a mechanism for easier discovery, encourage brevity, promote a single key binding for disparate data, and even help inject tone/personality.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those three factors are so strong, in fact, that <a href="http://tagboard.com">I co-founded a company</a> that basically attempts to reconcile them with my inherent distain for the way hashtags look. At Tagboard, we&#8217;re building tools that help both users and marketers use hashtags in a way that benefits both parties.</p>

<p>My opinion of hashtags is admitted bias, and equally manic. The thrust of my argument against hashtags is rooted in my design sense, while the engineer in me sees the yet-unrealized potential they have. Meanwhile, Sensible Sean sees hashtags as just harmless and fun.</p>
