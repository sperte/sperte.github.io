	<h2>Marketers are liars, not makers</h2>
	<h4>24 December 2012</h4>
	<p>When Seth Godin talks, I usually listen. I&#8217;ve read his books and follow (albeit loosely) his blog. So when a bunch of my peers began linking to a post of his yesterday, along with negative commentary, I was immediately interested.</p>

<p>His post is titled &#8220;<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/12/how-to-make-a-website-a-tactical-guide-for-marketers.html">How to make a website: a tactical guide for marketers</a>&#8221;, and if ever there was a list of bad starts of blogs posts, that one has to rank up there. I&#8217;ll explain why in a bit.</p>

<p>The post outlines various techniques Godin uses to make a website &#8211; including copy/pasting elements from other sites in Keynote. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a website, so the last step in Godin&#8217;s tactical guide is &#8220;Hand the Keynote doc to your developers and go away…&#8221;</p>

<p>His expertise in marketing notwithstanding, this advice for how to &#8216;make a website&#8217; is terrible. I appreciate Godin&#8217;s attempt at demystifying the process, and I recognize that giving practical advice for how marketers can work with their teams has great potential benefit. However, he would have done better to avoid the use of the words &#8216;make&#8217; or &#8216;build&#8217; altogether, and instead outlined how marketers can learn to make purposeful, high-level design decisions.</p>

<p>Godin argues that most of the web is built by amateurs. And in what could be considered a followup post, goes on to say the &#8220;best professionals love it when a passionate amateur shows up&#8221; &#8211; and, of course, uses a couple of comparisons, like farmers and automotive mechanics.</p>

<p>The problem with Godin&#8217;s perspective (and comparisons) is he thinks marketers are builders. He says &#8220;professional farmers don&#8217;t begrudge the backyard gardener his tomato harvest. That&#8217;s silly.&#8221; And, he&#8217;s right, because the backyard gardener is just that: a gardener. If, however, that gardener was a marketer who didn&#8217;t know anything about the science of growing vegetables, but who was growing them (in spite of himself) and selling them on the open market, and competing for market- and mind-share with reputable farmers…</p>

<p>Well, let&#8217;s just say I disagree that marketers &#8216;make websites&#8217;. They may be part of the process, but to suggest they can just throw together a slide deck and hand it off to a developer, and say they&#8217;re &#8216;building the web&#8217; … <em>that</em> is silly. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/all_marketers_are_liars/">Marketers are liars</a>, not makers.</p>
