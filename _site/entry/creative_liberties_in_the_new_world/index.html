	<h2>Creative Liberties in the New World</h2>
	<p>I highly respect Alex Payne, and always enjoy reading his posts. <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">His thoughts on the iPad</a>, though, don&#8217;t make sense to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this: if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I’d never be a programmer today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His argument is that Apple doesn&#8217;t leave room for tinkerers to tinker. Perhaps Payne is ignorantly dismissing the jailbreaking community in his observations, so I&#8217;ll give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>He clarified his comments in a &#8216;postscript&#8217;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my remark about not learning to program if I had an iPad wasn’t intended to be a blanket statement about <em>any</em> child not learning to program on the device. There are plenty of kids out there who are way smarter and more motivated than I was in my formative years, and I’m sure they’ll tinker no matter what obstacles are put in their way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">Exactly</a>.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s, for the sake of argument, pretend Apple has created a fully closed system that cannot be tinkered with, hacked or modified. If I&#8217;m understanding Payne&#8217;s point, in order to progress the digital age, Apple must open the system up to tinkering. His premise is, as he puts it, that the &#8216;hacker culture&#8217; has propelled the digital economy.</p>

<p>I disagree, respectfully.</p>

<p>This notion that a computing experience devoid of barriers is better for everyone is shortsighted. Barriers may be limiting to us computer nerds, but to everyone else they provide security. Additionally, it&#8217;s the barriers that serve as a challenge to tinkers, hackers and would-be developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point: true freedom &#8211; the kind of freedom that provides a platform for creativity &#8211; only comes from a place of security. Look at the US Constitution to find this model. In order to protect our liberties, we have Defenses to maintain our borders.</p>

<p>I think the opposite of Payne &#8211; that its the walled garden that will propel the digital economy. The limitations imposed by Apple in its system are both liberating (for consumers) and challenging (for geeks). (How&#8217;s that for a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5458690/the-problem-with-the-apple-ipad">dichotomy</a>?)</p>

<p>(And, for the record, in this dichotomy, we geeks are more important, not <a href="http://releasecandidateone.com/203:nothings_ever_black_white">less important</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I can&#8217;t not link to <a href="http://joehewitt.com/post/ipad/">Joe Hewitt&#8217;s post about the subject</a>. This is what he says (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Apple&#8217;s closed platform] gives me, as a developer, <em>a sense of power and potency and creativity like no other</em>. It makes the software market feel wide open again, like no one&#8217;s hegemony is <em>safe</em>. How anyone can feel underwhelmed by that is beyond me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think that those who are underwhelmed are focusing on iPad 1.0, and just need to sit tight and wait for the platform to grow up a little bit. They&#8217;ll come around.</p>
