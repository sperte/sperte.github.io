	<h2>Waiting on the MacBook Pro</h2>
	<p><img src="/assets/img/mbp2008-mockup.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro mockup by 'bayol05' of MacRumors forums" border="0" width="250" height="158" class="imgright" />It was with disbelief and frustration that I read this statement in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/02/03/new-macbook-pros-appearing-in-retail-inventory/">an article</a> published on MacRumors ten days ago (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the new MacBook Pros will likely incorporate only modest updates (Penryn and Multi-Touch), with their imminent release, <em>its hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d just hit &#8220;Submit&#8221; on an order for a MacBook Pro just 15 minutes earlier &#8211; after a furious internal debate over waiting or not. I knew revisions for the pro-line machines were coming, but with my current PowerBook G4 (early-2005) acting more like a boat anchor than a productivity tool, and with a demanding work schedule and task-list, I felt I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.</p>

<p>That statement shook me, though. <em>It&#8217;s hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>. It echoed in my head and haunted me for the rest of the evening &#8211; until I decided it was true. It <em>was</em> hard to justify it. In fact, it was too hard, so I cancelled my order.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m waiting, credit card in hand, for &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know. Based on the rumors, it sounds like the new MacBook Pros will have new, Penryn processors, feature the new multi-touch trackpad (as found on the MacBook Air), and possibly have a new enclosure and/or a black keyboard.</p>

<p>To me, none of those items are worth waiting for. Since I&#8217;m upgrading from a PPC G4, I&#8217;m apathetic to a processor update &#8211; I&#8217;d be happy with a 2GHz Core Duo right now. I couldn&#8217;t care less about the multi-touch trackpad. And a new enclosure is actually potentially bad for me, as I&#8217;ve happily touted a 15-inch, aluminum laptop around for years.</p>

<p>So, really, I guess I&#8217;m waiting for two reasons: (1) so I don&#8217;t buy a brand new laptop that is practically obsolete the day it&#8217;s delivered, and (2) in case Apple introduces a next-generation MacBook Pro instead of just a revision to the current one.</p>

<p>At least I don&#8217;t feel alone in my particular campaign. <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4861601#post4861601">Hundreds</a> (if not, thousands) of others are also waiting on the new MacBook Pros. Based on what I&#8217;ve read, these are serious buyers, not just fanboys who can&#8217;t wait to see what Apple has up their sleeve. With the MacBook Air missing a niche market of professional users, you can almost smell the money people are ready to throw at Apple for a new, full-featured laptop.</p>
