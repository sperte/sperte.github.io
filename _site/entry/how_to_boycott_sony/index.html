	<h2>How to Boycott Sony</h2>
	<p>With last Friday&#8217;s announcement from Sony that they were going to temporarily discontinue production of the CD&#8217;s that contained &#8220;XCP&#8221; (the Sony DRM), I wish I could say the boycott is off. It&#8217;s not: The announcement was inadaquate compared to the crime, and unethical practices like these must be seriously addressed by the public. That means <strong>you</strong>. Click through to boycott Sony, even if you&#8217;re not fully convinced you need to yet. 
First thing&#8217;s first, you need to understand the situation. I&#8217;ll make this as plain and simple as I can: <em>Sony has knowingly voilated computer-users&#8217; rights by using a method of employing a copy-protection software that is more commonly used in spyware and virus attacks</em>. Need proof?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark&#8217;s Sysinternals reports in detail how this software is maliciously installed and masked: <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">Click here to read</a></li>
<li>Microsoft is calling the DRM spyware and will <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/archive/2005/11/12/414299.aspx">remove it automatically in its security updates</a> starting this month (as reported by the <a href="http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2005/11/microsoft_label.html">Washington Post</a>)</li>
<li>Sony is facing several lawsuits because of the DRM: <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27508">From the ALCEI</a>, <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004149.php">EFF</a>, and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/10/0024259&amp;from=rss">even the state of California</a></li>
<li>Programmers and coders all over the world responded with exasperation, asking, &#8220;what coder in their right mind would do something like this?&#8221; (<a href="http://www.pigdog.org/auto/software_jihad/link/2581.html">A &#8220;colorful&#8221; example</a>)</li>
<li>Boycotts have been called for, both in the blogsphere and now in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,69559,00.html?tw=rss.TOP">mainstream media</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so you now understand the seriousness of the situation, but what&#8217;s it to you, right? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you &#8211; <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/geekandmild/entry/rootkit_2_doom_and_gloom/">no, wait, I already told you</a>. If you still don&#8217;t think this affects you, then I ask you for you to help the boycott by shear courtesy to me and the rest of the freedom-loving world.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some reasons I&#8217;m boycotting Sony:</p>

<ul>
<li>I think what they&#8217;ve done deserves an extreme response</li>
<li>I like my digital freedoms more than I like Sony products, though I love Sony products and own many already</li>
<li>I want Sony to know that though I&#8217;ve been a patron of their company until now, practices like these make enemies</li>
<li>I truly want Sony to change, so I can continue to buy their stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>You ready to start boycotting now? Okay, we need to understand something: Sony wants to give consumers a good product/service almost as bad as they want the money consumers pay for it; they&#8217;re generally out to please consumers. So the boycott is going to be two-fold in its approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>We cease from purchasing goods and services from Sony (this means music, consumer electronics, feature films, etc.).</li>
<li>We tell Sony what we want</li>
</ol>

<p>The first step will hopefully tell Sony we&#8217;re serious enough about our purchases to trade inconvenience for freedom. They may never fully feel an economic bite, but hopefully the bark will be loud enough to scare them.</p>

<p>Secondly, we <em>must</em> give them a way out. I don&#8217;t know how we can deploy a mainstream way of doing this, so I&#8217;ve just emailed them directly and told them how I feel (<a href="http://www.seansperte.com/files/sony_boycott_letter.txt">read/download the text-only copy</a>). Feel free to use my letter as a template for your own, or just change the name if you want. It was difficult to find a place to send the letter, so I just used the Sony Music feedback form. I&#8217;m considering just using every feedback form I can find on Sony&#8217;s sites. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>So going back to our first mission, here are some things to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumer electronics, like radios, CD players, televisions (ugh, this one hurts)</li>
<li>Mobile devices like MP3 players, cellphones (Sony Ericsson), and digital cameras</li>
<li>Music from Sony BMG (even online from iTunes, or other music store)</li>
<li>Feature films like &#8220;The Da Vinci Code&#8221;, &#8220;Zathura&#8221;, and &#8220;Freedomland&#8221;</li>
<li>Games and the PSP (I know you wanted one for Christmas, but just wait until this is all over with and get yourself the PS3)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s not going to be easy, especially this Holiday season. However, I have to believe it will be worth it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: EFF seems to have a better grasp on the steps needed be taken by Sony in order to satisfy consumers: <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/?f=open-letter-2005-11-14.html">Read &#8220;An Open Letter to Sony-BMG&#8221;</a>.</p>
