	<h2>iTunes variable pricing</h2>
	<h4>27 November 2005</h4>
	<p>For the record, if Apple caves and begins selling songs in a variable pricing scheme, I&#8217;ll turn back to <a href="http://www.acquisitionx.com/">Aquisition</a> or <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/home.shtml">LimeWire</a>. The reason I don&#8217;t buy CD&#8217;s anymore is not because I&#8217;m stealing music; it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m buying the music (or more accurately, the <em>songs</em>) I want at a fixed price.</p>

<p>Apple has achieved a very, very nice balance for music purchasing. I&#8217;m not bothered (too much) by the DRM embedded in each song I buy, and I don&#8217;t mind paying $0.99 per song. Up that price, though, or change the DRM limitations, and I&#8217;m out like trout. I don&#8217;t mind saying I&#8217;m on the edge and could tip at the slightest shift in environment.</p>

<p>To Apple directly I say this: I understand you&#8217;re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You want to offer me the best and widest range of content to me at a great price, but those [edited] record labels keep tugging at your money pockets and driving you nuts. Well don&#8217;t listen to them. Since when have they done anything for you? Remember, you are who you are <em>not</em> because of the iPod but because of your <em>ideas</em>. You just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing &#8211; putting the music industry through digital rehabilitation &#8211; and let the record labels cough and hack until they&#8217;re &#8220;well&#8221; again.</p>
