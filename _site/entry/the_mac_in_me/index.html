	<h2>The Mac in Me</h2>
	<p>When Matt Heerema <a href="http://twitter.com/mheerema/statuses/132872532">called me</a> the poor-man&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Gruber</a> I realized I should probably explain my preoccupation with all things Apple.</p>

<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve been a Macintosh user/owner since the mid-80&#8217;s &#8211; most of my life. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;ve used every OS since version 6</span>, and can recollect, without help from Google, the major changes in each revision. So I have a lot of personal history with Apple products.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest reason I&#8217;m such an Apple loyalist, though, is because I subscribe to the idea that technology should (and can) be as simple as it is powerful. Whether it&#8217;s the iPod or Mac OS, everything Apple produces seems designed to compliment &#8211; not hinder or add-to &#8211; my lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;m a perfectionist, I&#8217;m also very keen to the attention to detail Apple gives to their products. They&#8217;re polished, complete, and picture-perfect. Apple <del>never</del> <ins>rarely</ins> releases anything to the public without it having the white-glove inspection, and red-carpet treatment.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not all about the hype, either. Their great communication is only possible because of their <em>insanely</em> great products. Take, for instance, the iPhone commercials: Notice the lack of bulleted lists of features, pricing, and on-screen graphics. They&#8217;re just 30 seconds of the product, and the interface &#8211; center-stage, no CG and &lt;a href="http://www.cnettv.com/9710-1_53-28172.html?k="iphone"&amp;tag=cnetfd.vid"&gt;no trickery.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to discredit the awesome marketing team behind Apple&#8217;s campaigns. Whether TV spot, billboard, online graphic, etc.; there&#8217;s no confusing Apple message when promoting. Each ad is like a mini-movie &#8211; executed perfectly. Script, timing, story, continuity, style, tone &#8230; it&#8217;s all well-thought out.</p>

<p>I love &#8216;em. I love their style, their mission, and their model.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple&#8217;s not perfect. That attention to detail I mentioned isn&#8217;t always utilized in every release. Quality control has seemed to suffer as Apple&#8217;s popularity has grown. And lately the Mac OS is more an interface mash-up; anything but congruent. Actually, Apple frequently ignores their own interface guidelines, I guess in the name of innovation.</p>

<p>In that way, though, the company is even the more relatable. The truth is, if Apple didn&#8217;t have flaws I&#8217;d be worried. It&#8217;s the human element, imperfections included, that generates both its beauty and defect.</p>

<p>For me, the Mac, iPod and iPhone are easy to champion, because if I were to start a company it would look like Apple.</p>
