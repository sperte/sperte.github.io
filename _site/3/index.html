		<h2><a href="/entry/giving_credit_versus_giving_appreciation">Giving credit versus giving appreciation</a></h2>
		<p>The way I see it, I should credit the original author or creator of a work, without question. However, I&#8217;m <a href="http://chuckskoda.com/entry/my-via-code-of-conduct/">not going to stress</a> over giving credit (e.g. &#8220;via so-and-so&#8221;) to the person or website that relays the link to the work to me via RSS, tweet, email or otherwise. If I can &#8211; meaning the tools are there for me to automatically do so &#8211; I will. Otherwise, I&#8217;m not going to go out of my way to credit someone for merely passing on a link. (It&#8217;s the internet, after all. It&#8217;s made of links.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying posting a link to something isn&#8217;t worthy of some appreciation. That&#8217;s different. I will do my best to thank those that link to something I take an interest in, and/or pass on to my followers and readers. And, where possible, I&#8217;ll do so using the same medium. For example, if I follow a link in a tweet that I find interesting, I&#8217;ll reply using Twitter.</p>

<p>In other words, you don&#8217;t always have to reward the messenger, just thank them.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/google_seo_spam_and_connecting_consumers_with_businesses">Google, SEO, spam, and connecting consumers with businesses</a></h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2617546197">Marco Arment&#8217;s thoughts about Google&#8217;s decreasing usefulness</a> are, as usual, very insightful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been frustrated as well by Google’s apparent defeat by spam. It’s not a sudden issue — it’s been gradually worsening for a few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His analogy of what it&#8217;s like to search on Google reminds me of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN28Ad3TNrQ">Bing ads</a>, &#8220;What has search overload done to us?&#8221;. Until I read his post, I thought the ads were sort of stupid. Now, I see their point.</p>

<p>Without saying it outright, Marco blames spammers and SEOists for the mess of search results. He also concludes that the problem could possibly be fixed by Google altering its algorithms and/or employing human-based filtering.</p>

<p>I agree. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>My father recently helped start an SEO and internet strategy company &#8211; he&#8217;s one of the good guys, though. The problem he saw were small, local businesses getting their mediocre, outdated websites buried in searches behind pages and pages of spam and irrelevant results. His aim is to connect the local consumer with the local business, so when someone types &#8220;furnace repair in Kirkland, WA&#8221; they get the equivalent of what they&#8217;d normally get when looking in the yellow pages.</p>

<p>Right now, the only way he can play the game is by the currently existing rules, which include semantic markup and PageRank &#8211; and AdWords, if you want to count advertising. But for a local business to increase their PageRank against spam and content/link farms, even if they&#8217;ve worked really hard, they&#8217;ve got to get lucky &#8211; with, for instance, the user typing the exact keywords, or lots of blogosphere exposure. It&#8217;s not that easy. So my dad has to use some (clean) SEO tactics.</p>

<p>You could say my dad is employed because of the problem with Google results spam, but that&#8217;s not really true. Actually, what he&#8217;s found is that many local businesses need more than just SEO, they need full websites and internet strategies. Even if Google results were fixed tomorrow, they&#8217;d still lack many relevant, local results because there <em>are none</em>.</p>

<p>(By the way, this isn&#8217;t a new problem (local businesses not having a web presence), but my dad&#8217;s company provides a unique solution in that it has a man-on-the-street sales force that most web design firms don&#8217;t. He&#8217;s reaching a market that&#8217;s not previously been reached.)</p>

<p>One thing is clear: barring a major PR misstep, scandal or other unforeseen catastrophe, Google will remain the de-facto standard for searching on the web. So unless we&#8217;re comfortable working harder and harder to find the answers we want, we need Google to step in and offer more than just facelifts and live results.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_mysterious_opera_browser">The Mysterious Opera Browser</a></h2>
		<p>For weeks Opera, the web browser that just won&#8217;t go away, has been vying for file ownership and default web browsing on my MacBook Pro. I never installed it, so it puzzled me to see it listed in the list of potential applications to open, say, an HTML file. Spotlight searches turned up nothing, as did casual browsing through system and application support folders. I should have done it sooner, but I finally turned to my friend, Google.</p>

<p>It turns out Opera is installed with Adobe CS4. (Now there&#8217;s a funny word: &#8220;installed&#8221;.) I take offense to that. You see, I never gave Adobe permission to install an alternative web browser on my computer, I don&#8217;t care what the 900-page Terms and Conditions said. When I installed CS4 I wanted and expected graphics-making software, not web browsing software. Aside from the fact that what I expect is often furthest from what I get with Adobe software, even if I was somehow tricked into agreeing to receive a fresh copy of an extraneous web browser, it would be a nice courtesy to place it in the Applications folder. But instead, it&#8217;s embedded into the package contents of Adobe Bridge CS4 application, two folders down. Did you read that? It was <em>embedded in another application</em>. Not in the Application Support folder, or Library folder(s), or Utilities folder, or AdobeHelperToolsAndApplications folder, or any other rationally sane location.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Screen_shot_2010-12-30_at_111.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-12-30 at 11.03.05 PM.png" title="Screen shot 2010-12-30 at 11.03.05 PM.png" border="0" width="500" height="216" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I can only think of three possible reasons to embed an application inside another application:</p>

<ol>
<li>To display Help files &#8211; but then, why not just use the system&#8217;s default web browser?</li>
<li>To power a feature/function of the containing app that isn&#8217;t a part of its core design &#8211; but then, why not build it in using WebKit?</li>
<li>To satisfy a contract wherein Adobe must illegitimately install a copy of Opera on users&#8217; computers in exchange for fame and fortune and a week timeshare in Cabo.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m being only slightly facetious here. Honestly, I can&#8217;t think of any other reason to justify the logic of including a copy of Opera.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe one more: to confuse and/or annoy people. And if Adobe did include Opera for that reason, they succeeded with me.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>deleted</em>.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/friends">15 December 2010</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/friends">Friends</a></h2>
		<p>Today, <a href="http://taptivate.com/friends/">Taptivate released a new iPhone app called Friends</a>. From the description summary, it looks like the app promises to solve the problem of keeping up with your friends&#8217; status updates, photos, blogs, etc. But in just few minutes I&#8217;ve had to play around with it, I&#8217;ve discovered it falls well short of delivering on that promise.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t make a habit of being vocal about my negative opinions, and I don&#8217;t often criticize other people&#8217;s (hard) work. I play a lead role in a hobbyist software company, and I understand the difficulties in designing and developing an iOS app. So please just consider this a tempered tangent. I hope my thoughts are as much constructive as they are critical.</p>

<p>Really, this Friends app is a mess. It&#8217;s a good case study in how a great idea requires great execution in order for it to be realized &#8211; ideas don&#8217;t stand on their own. It&#8217;s also an example of how great graphic design cannot compensate for poor interface design.</p>

<p>Where do I begin? Let&#8217;s start with the default screen &#8211; which is called &#8220;home&#8221;, I believe:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/assets/img/friendsapp-home.jpg" alt="Friends home screen" title="friendsapp-home.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="375" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Putting aside the fact that the aesthetic of this screen suggests the app is designed more for utility than relationship and/or entertainment, there&#8217;s so much wrong here.</p>

<p>First, there are no indicators to let me know if or what is new or updated. In fact, the only indicator on this screen at all is just a count indicator in the Contacts row, the purpose of which is &#8230; so I know how many contacts I have? Okay, thanks. I guess.</p>

<p>If Friends is supposed to help keep me in touch with my friends, it&#8217;s off to a bad start by requiring me to take action by tapping a &#8211; well, what are these rows? Categories? Beside the icons (which are another matter entirely), there are no visual cues to tell me what to do or where to go. The labels themselves offer little help in deciphering the organization of the app, particularly because the relationship between labels isn&#8217;t entirely clear. The only sense of organization or hierarchy is found in the separation of the top table &#8211; of groupings? &#8211; and the bottom one.</p>

<p><strong>Core problem #1</strong>: The app requires a question (&#8220;where do I go?/what do I do?&#8221;), answer (&#8220;I think I want to see what&#8217;s new&#8221;), and solution (after searching, &#8220;I guess I tap Posts&#8221;) from the user on its home screen.</p>

<p>So, most people will spend the bulk of their time on the &#8220;Posts&#8221; screen, which you get to by tapping the Posts row.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/assets/img/friendsapp-posts.jpg" alt="Friends posts screen" title="friendsapp-posts.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="375" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>There are some technical issues with this screen &#8211; in relationship to the app refreshing and organizing new status updates or tweets when you&#8217;re trying to scroll, making it so you lose your place. I won&#8217;t go beyond mentioning them, as they&#8217;ll likely be something addressed in updates. Besides, the Posts screen is annoying all by itself, even without the technical issues.</p>

<p>Friends is about friends, so I get that there are no indicators of which service (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) the &#8220;post&#8221; came from. The goal, I believe, is to downplay the service and focus on the relationship. Okay, fine. But why then is the design a traditional timeline that doesn&#8217;t give priority to the user icons and names? And why, on subsequent screens &#8211; such as the &#8220;Conversation&#8221;/&#8221;Comments&#8221; screen &#8211; am I allowed to comment or reply to Facebook status updates but not tweets? And why are the labels and icons different based on which service? Functions might be different between services, but there must be a way to reconcile them in a way that doesn&#8217;t restrict user interaction.</p>

<p><strong>Core problem #2</strong>: The app can&#8217;t make up its mind. Is it about relationships and friends? Great, then do as much as possible to make service-related functions invisible. Is it about aggregating all the services in one place? Fine, then do so in a clear way so the user knows exactly what is what, where it came from, and how to interact with it.</p>

<p>But maybe instead of a status app, Friends was more designed to be a contacts manager. Let&#8217;s take a look at the Contacts screen:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/assets/img/friendsapp-contacts.jpg" alt="Friends contacts screen" title="friendsapp-contacts.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="375" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>The Contacts screen is pretty standard, with a photo of the contact next to their name, and a balloon icon next to contacts with a birthday coming up (yellow for within 30 days, red for within two weeks), a nice touch. Unfortunately, contacts are ordered by last name (with no setting to change that), and the photos are really slow to load, even after they&#8217;ve previously been loaded. (There&#8217;s also some bugs on this screen that cause contacts to appear and disappear randomly.)</p>

<p>Tapping on a contact reveals a unified information screen for that contact. Tabs on the right-hand side of the screen reveal the contact&#8217;s posts (from any/all services), their contact info (on your iOS device), Twitter profile, Facebook profile, LinkedIn profile, or MySpace profile.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/assets/img/friendsapp-contact.jpg" alt="Friends contact screen" title="friendsapp-contact.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="375" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I found this unified information screen to share the same problems as the Posts screen in terms lacking a defined goal. It&#8217;s neither a great interaction tool nor a utility for managing contact information. Going a step further, simple interactions are either hidden or confusing &#8211; or worse yet, unavailable. For example, there&#8217;s no way to text (SMS) a contact from within the app, though if you tap on their number it will immediately call them (on an iPhone). I accidentally dialed three contacts before learning my lesson.</p>

<p><strong>Core problem #3</strong>: It&#8217;s actually more confusing (and potentially frustrating) to use Friends to contact a friend or manage their information than it is using dedicated apps such as Contacts, Messages, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>

<p>There are also an unusual amount of UI inconsistencies and technical issues throughout the app. Some random, miscellaneous examples I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s no indication of the app refreshing on the home screen.</li>
<li>The Groups screen shows I have 759 contacts in &#8220;All Contacts&#8221; but on the default home screen the &#8220;Contacts&#8221; row shows only 230. What&#8217;s the difference? Why should I even care?</li>
<li>A huge amount a visual priority is given to show me how many mutual friends I have with a contact &#8211; like it&#8217;s supposed to be the most important piece of information to me.</li>
<li>Not all linked photos are displayed inline, but many are. What&#8217;s the difference?</li>
<li>Contacts &#8220;open&#8221; on a particular tab depending on the information and/or service available for that contact, causing unneeded confusion. (I even ran into a few contacts that didn&#8217;t have any posts, so their screen didn&#8217;t even have any tabs at all.)</li>
<li>Email addresses don&#8217;t show up on a contact&#8217;s information screen, though their fields do. This could be an issue with my unique installation, but it&#8217;s still a bug.</li>
<li>At one point the &#8220;Pull down to refresh&#8221; labels disappeared even though the function still worked. A force-quit and relaunch of the app fixed it.</li>
<li>Creating and/or managing Groups and Lists is a chore, requiring you to scroll through the full list of your contacts (one row per contacts&#8217; service/user), with no search or filter options.</li>
<li>And what&#8217;s the difference between Groups and Lists again?</li>
<li>No timestamps. Really?</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s not to mention the crashes &#8211; three so far.</p>

<p>Like I said, this app is a mess. It&#8217;s really a shame, too, because the idea is such a great one. A platform-independent way to connect with and interact with your friends is a wonderful concept, and something that&#8217;s not built-in to the iPhone or iOS, as it is with the Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Taptivate did some things right, and they should get credit for that. There are some nice graphic touches and polishes that would be great to see in other apps like Twitter or Facebook.</p>

<p>Every issue I have with Friends boils down to this: Friends doesn&#8217;t solve any problems for me. If anything, it creates them.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/on_blogging">13 December 2010</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/on_blogging">On Blogging</a></h2>
		<p>The various tech devices I own, such as the iPad, make the consumption of content &#8211; blogs, tweets, video, and miscellaneous web things &#8211; a joy. (Actually, I guess it&#8217;s more the software on the devices: Twitter for iPhone, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>, and <a href="http://fanzter.com/products/summizer">Summizer</a>.) Because of that I&#8217;m finding myself, here in December 2010, more motivated to read and watch content online, than I am to create it. Which, for me, is a new thing.</p>

<p>With Twitter, I still have <em>some</em> <a href="http://twitter.com/sperte">creative outlet</a> &#8211; in the form of short, concise statements. And I admit, it&#8217;s easy to become obsessed with drafting the Perfect Tweet. (The number of retweets, favorites and @replies help provide a subjective metric for which to gauge a tweet&#8217;s relative perfection, just so you know.) Twitter is a great medium for recording the moments of life that usually happen too quickly to remember, or for capturing fleeting thoughts. Or for sharing a link or photo. In fact, since starting Geek &amp; Mild in 2005, I&#8217;ve always published links I want to share inline with blog posts &#8211; a format used by <a href="http://kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>. But now that I&#8217;m using Twitter to share links, Geek &amp; Mild sits mostly inactive.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been thinking about all this; all the reasons I haven&#8217;t been writing or blogging. Lack of time has little to do with it. I think it&#8217;s more a motivation thing. I just haven&#8217;t been motivated to blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to change that.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve decided is that I&#8217;m going to start experimenting with some new formatting for Geek &amp; Mild.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;m going to completely remove and archive the &#8216;asides&#8217;. They&#8217;ll still be accessible for searching and viewing, but will no longer be inline with blog posts.</p>

<p>Secondly, the obligatory redesign. I&#8217;m going to update the design and aesthetic.</p>

<p>And finally, and most importantly, I&#8217;m going to stop worrying about trying to be perfect. I think one of the primary reasons for my lack of motivation is the desire to only publish perfect posts. And by perfect, I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;technically perfect&#8221;. God knows I&#8217;d never publish <em>anything</em> if perfect grammar was the standard. I mean perfect in vision; worth-while for a reader. I&#8217;ve decided to let that worry go.</p>

<p>After all, who cares? I&#8217;ve realized Geek &amp; Mild is as much for me as it is for its readers. Actually, it&#8217;s probably more for me. I need to write &#8211; or spew &#8211; more than the world needs to read. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to do any of this in the first place. I considered just shutting down my blog, but the thought of not having an outlet for writing bummed me out. Twitter&#8217;s great, but <a href="http://twitter.com/ConanOBrien/status/11550525229105152">there&#8217;s only so much you can fit into 140 characters</a>.</p>

<p>So, timeline? I&#8217;m not sure. Sooner rather than later. In fact, I may start refactoring the blog format immediately after publishing this. I already have a few ideas for a new look that I might start to mock up, too.</p>

<p>Stick around, if you want.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Last night after publishing this post I prepared to archive all the aside posts and came across <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/shawn_blanc_on_the_link_post/">one from last year</a> in which I listed the reasons I post asides. Needless to say, I re-convinced myself of their place on Geek &amp; Mild, and in my digital life.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/hello_helvetica">Hello, Helvetica</a></h2>
		<p>The Notes app on the iPhone is darn near perfect &#8211; and about to get a whole lot better with over the air syncing via MobileMe in iOS 4. My only gripe is the use of Marker Felt. I know I&#8217;m not alone.</p>

<p>There are ways to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/09/hacking_the_iphone_notes_app">hack the Notes app to use Helvetica</a>, but they all require SSH access, or, in other words, a jailbroken iPhone. I just discovered an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require hackery and takes just a few seconds to set up.</p>

<p>Open the Settings app and tap on <strong>General</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hh-settings.jpg" alt="hh-settings.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Then tap on <strong>Keyboard</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hh-keyboard.jpg" alt="hh-keyboard.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Then tap <strong>International Keyboards</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hh-intlkeyboards.jpg" alt="hh-intlkeyboards.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Then tap on <strong>Chinese - Simplified (Handwriting)</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hh-simpchinese.jpg" alt="hh-simpchinese.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Now go back to your home screen and open the Notes app. Select a note, and tap anywhere to bring up the keyboard. Now tap on the <strong>International Keyboards</strong> key to bring up the character drawing interface.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hh-intlkey.jpg" alt="hh-intlkey.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Draw a line, and the font your note uses will change to Helvetica.</p>

<p>Tap <strong>Done</strong>. Hello, Helvetica.</p>

<p>The obvious drawbacks to this method are that (1) you have to repeat the last few steps for every note you edit or start, and (2) you now have another key taking up space in your keyboard, which effectively halves the size of the Number/Symbol key.</p>

<p>Still, Helvetica.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/read_ability">Read Ability</a></h2>
		<p>Though it wasn&#8217;t mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s WWDC keynote, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari was updated to version 5</a>, and now has a faster JavaScript engine, Bing support, and a cool new plain-text article view based on Arc90&#8217;s <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">excellent &#8216;Readability&#8217;</a>, called Reader.</p>

<p>The Arc90 team distributes the core Readability script as open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. I just happen to know about that, don&#8217;t ask me why. Which means Apple was able to integrate it into Safari with little effort and no collaboration with Arc90. In fact, <a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2010/06/07/safari-5-another-step-towards-better-reading-on-the-web/">Arc90 didn&#8217;t know Readability was being used until after Safari 5 was released</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve since discovered that Safari’s “Reader” feature is, in fact, based upon our own Readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisdary/status/15672452287">does acknowledge Arc90/Readability in Safari&#8217;s acknowledgements</a>, which is cool. It&#8217;s just funny to me that Apple didn&#8217;t even notify them.</p>

<p>So anyway, <a href="http://twitter.com/sky_balloon/status/15638642616">hypothetically</a>, if there was a beautiful iPad browser that, among other cool features, had a &#8216;Reader&#8217; view, would you want it to [continue to be developed and] be released, even if Mobile Safari will likely have said &#8216;Reader&#8217; view in the future?</p>
