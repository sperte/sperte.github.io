<h2 id="personalized-scripture-in-your-pocket">Personalized scripture in your pocket</h2>

<p>Me and two others took on designing and building a Rhema card iPhone app. We weren’t sure if it was something others would want, but we did – and we wanted to hone our skills for creating mobile apps.</p>

<div class="gallery">
  <a href="browse-1.jpg"><img src="browse-1.jpg" /></a>
  <a href="browse-3.jpg"><img src="browse-3.jpg" /></a>
  <a href="browse-5.jpg"><img src="browse-5.jpg" /></a>
  <a href="browse-6.jpg"><img src="browse-6.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<p>I started off by brainstorming what the user experience should be, and eventually landed on a digital workflow borrowing heavily from the “card” metaphor. For the UI and visual treatment I probably went overboard with skeuomorphic textures and effects.</p>

<h2 id="iconic-references">Iconic references</h2>

<p>I had opinionated preference for how iPhone app icons should look, so I took great care and time in creating the Rhema app icon.</p>

<p><img src="emblem-and-icon.png" /></p>

<p>The original Rhema cards had an emblem as part of the masthead that had – along with the colors and typography – become a sort of the brand. I didn’t want to depart too much from this established aesthetic, so I attempted to integrate the emblem into the icon with varying degrees of success across iterations.</p>

<p>I finally landed on an icon that both honored the past, but also looked and felt great on the iPhone’s digital screen.</p>

<h2 id="an-instant-classic">An instant classic</h2>

<p>After we published the app to the App Store (for free) word quickly spread about its existence. Our small team of three was taken aback by its almost-immediate cultural success and relevance – at least in our small circles. It became, as we were told, a must-have homepage app for our church community.</p>
