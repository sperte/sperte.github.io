		<h2><a href="/entry/on_ds_lite_ownership">On DS Lite Ownership</a></h2>
		<p>It&#8217;s been about 6 weeks since I ditched <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/psp/">my PSP</a> and got myself a real game-playing portable device: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ds_lite">The Nintendo DS Lite</a>. How has it held up to my expectations as an admitted non-gamer, gadget-saavy, tech-head? Unbelievably. 
I can&#8217;t stop raving about this thing. From the form factor, to the fun and exciting gameplay, to the incredible ease-of-use, to the awesome feature set (with an almost over-the-counter feel), <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;m quite convinced the DS Lite is a must-have for anyone</span>. I&#8217;m talking to you. Yes, you. You&#8217;re anyone, right? Go now, do yourself a favor, and pick up a DS Lite.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my good friend Matt is. He was a hard-core PSP owner, with tons of games. Shortly after I picked up my DS Lite and showed it off a bit, he sold his PSP and games (plus a UMD movie), and hasn&#8217;t looked back. This is the guy who convinced me to get a PSP and was against me selling it when I did.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my grandma is. She picked up her DS Lite about three weeks ago (by my advice) and now has at least 4 games and some accessories. She just emailed me to ask when I&#8217;d be over to meet her new puppy &#8211; apparently she got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my wife is. She actually hasn&#8217;t picked one up yet because we&#8217;re waiting for the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/27/pink-is-the-new-ds-lite/">pink version</a> &#8211; but she asks to play mine all the time. She loves it.</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? Okay, lightning round:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only $130 retail</li>
<li>Games are $35 (when they&#8217;re brand-new)</li>
<li>It supports GameBoy Advanced games</li>
<li>WiFi gameplay supports games against other DS owners with OR without the particular game you have, AND online gaming against people all over the world</li>
<li>Speakers are incredible, with surround-sound like sound</li>
<li>A microphone enables online chatting and fun game features (such a blowing up your balloons in the battle mode of Mario Kart DS)</li>
<li>An easy-to-use system menu with clock, calendar, alarm clock and chatting application</li>
<li>Potential to surf the web (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbSq-tCHXmI">Opera is developing a cool web browser</a>)</li>
<li>Will play (nice) with the up-and-coming Wii console system</li>
<li>Practically zero load times</li>
<li>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q="ds+lite"+accessories&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;Accessories galore</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-second-look.html">Cool video reviews</a> (never saw those for the PSP, didja?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So &#8230; convinced <em>yet</em>? Of course you are. You&#8217;re not even reading this, you&#8217;re on your way to Target or GameSpot to pick one up now, right?</p>

<p><del>See</del> <ins>Play</ins> ya online. (Don&#8217;t forget to practice your <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/snaked/">snaking</a>.)</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/flattery">Flattery</a></h2>
		<p>It seems <a href="http://www.thecity.org/">The City Church</a> isn&#8217;t the only design being ripped off lately. Khoi Vinh, a well-known designer, had his personal blog design <del>copied</del> <ins>emulated</ins> by an architectural institution. He <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/0713_plagiarism_i.php">wrote about it</a>, admitting he was at a loss for course of action, and the comment thread that followed could literally be bound as a novel. Long story short: The designer responsible for the institution&#8217;s site apologized for misinterpreting Khoi&#8217;s copyright notice and removed the design, defaulting back to a previous one. It&#8217;s a happy ending, but the discussion is still going on Khoi&#8217;s site &#8230; <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/0713_plagiarism_i.php">do check it out</a>. (And don&#8217;t skip the comments.) 
So my thoughts immediately go to this <a href="http://www.joomlart.com/templates_club/club_portfolio/ja_regulus.html">Joomlart rip off</a> of our (or <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse&#8217;s</a>) design, which is more than a little &#8220;inspired&#8221;. We&#8217;ve clearly placed a copyright notice (including the &#8220;all rights reserved&#8221; clause) on every single page of the site, but some <em>still defend</em> the template and its designers, stating that it&#8217;s not an exact copy, and that the source code is completely different (<a href="http://forum.joomla.org/index.php/topic,76641.0.html">source</a>).</p>

<p>Now, since The City Church site has received so much attention (did you see we won two <a href="http://awards.cssmania.com/2006/07/07/css-world-awards-winners-2006.php">CSS Mania awards</a>?! Woohoo!), I anticipated having to deal with plagiarism, to some extent. In fact, I&#8217;ve even been asked if I&#8217;d email the PSD and source files to someone so they could copy the site for their own use &#8211; you know, since they were &#8220;located so far away&#8221;. Right. <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;m not opposed to people taking the design and code for educational purposes</span>, but straight-up copying is cheap and (in my personal opinion) unethical.</p>

<p>I know Jesse deals with this all the time, and I&#8217;ve read other designer&#8217;s blogs as they&#8217;ve engaged in the same sort of battles, with their own designs being stolen or repurposed. My position has always stayed the same: I&#8217;m with the designers.</p>

<p>See, there&#8217;s just two sides to this issue, and two kinds of people involved:</p>

<ol>
<li>The designers or design-saavy &#8211; those that understand design to be a commodity, something valued as much (or more) than physical objects that can be traded, bought and sold.</li>
<li>The design-wannabes or genuinely ignorant &#8211; those that think design is liquid and free, something of lesser value than, say, source code. These people also attack designers personally, citing the designer&#8217;s inability to see the &#8220;big picture.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, before I go further let me clarify and say that while it&#8217;s evident the Joomlart template has been built from the ground-up, and the designers (apparently a team?) that worked on it probably worked very hard, <span class="pullquote alt">it still emulates elements of The City Church design too closely to be considered original</span>.</p>

<p>Also, what makes this case unique is the fact that our design is being redistributed and <em>sold</em>. You must be a member of the Joomlart site in order to download the template, and a membership costs $40 per year. The fact that others can download, easily install and use this template/design in about 5 minutes makes this even more sticky. How could Joomlart cleanup should they somehow see the error of their ways? They&#8217;d have to contact each member and ask them to, out of the kindness of their heart, stop using the template.</p>

<p>Ugh. This is not flattery.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/snaked">Snaked</a></h2>
		<p>By way of a simple warning, let me just say that if you think you&#8217;re hot stuff on Mario Kart DS and find yourself wanting to try the online gameplay, <em>don&#8217;t</em> &#8211; at least not until you&#8217;ve mastered the art of &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=203nqmV8OX">snaking</a>&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just learned this the hard way. 
Apparently a strategy of the elite MK&#8217;ers is to use a power-slide technique that gives a quick boost, and to do so over and over again on courses that allow (those that don&#8217;t have drop-offs or narrow curves). I know this technique, but haven&#8217;t quite mastered pulling it off the way these guys do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.n-philes.com/forums/showthread.php?t=22049">There&#8217;s plenty of debate</a> over this so-called &#8220;skill&#8221;, with arguments both for and against it. One thought is that since it&#8217;s part of the game, and not a glitch, learning it is part of advancing your skill, and what separates you from being a beginner. The other opinion is that <span class="pullquote">it alienates newcomers and robs from the spirit of the game</span>. I&#8217;ll go ahead and say that I subscribe to the latter argument &#8211; as I am completely frustrated with the technique being used against me during my first online race.</p>

<p>If I sound bitter it&#8217;s because I am. After all, I&#8217;m not half-bad! :)</p>

<p>I look at it this way: The game was designed to be used with certain &#8220;items&#8221; that, used in conjunction with dynamic driving, should make for a fun and somewhat fair competition. Using the snaking technique completely eliminates the need for items &#8211; as most snakers don&#8217;t even use their L button (the one used to deploy whatever item is in reserve). Really, watching the tutorial videos of snaking, and observing what I did just now in my online race, I cannot see how that could be fun after a week.</p>

<p>But it is just a game, after all, and while I&#8217;d love to continue ranting about it I&#8217;ve got some snaking practice to get in.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/the_rosetta_dilemma">The Rosetta Dilemma</a></h2>
		<p>My first order of business after receiving a MacBook Pro on loan for 4-8 weeks was to install and run Adobe&#8217;s Creative Suite 2. What I found in initial testing was what I had feared: Rosetta&#8217;s emulation doesn&#8217;t cut it for Photoshop. 
To be fair, Apple&#8217;s done a fantastic job at something that&#8217;s potentially mind-blowing in terms of software engineering. To the end user, Rosetta is virtually transparent, meaning if you launch an application that&#8217;s not compiled to run on the Intel processor then you&#8217;ll never notice Rosetta stepping in and claiming juris-my-diction (/end crude Matrix reference). The application&#8217;s icon bounces in the dock a few more times, perhaps, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>When you consider what exactly Rosetta is doing then you&#8217;ve got to be impressed by it. Every CPU call; every calculation; every process; everything must go through an emulation cycle &#8211; potentially <em>doubling</em> the operation&#8217;s time and distance. For Rosetta to be as fast as it is shows a lot: Apple did a great job. In fact, that Apple even designed and built Rosetta speaks highly of their dedication to their user base (consumers and developers alike).</p>

<p>My observation is that Rosetta&#8217;s speed is comparable to a typical pre-Intel Mac&#8217;s. I tested several (read: &#8220;2 or 3&#8221;) non-universal applications and found that while I noticed a speed difference &#8211; the rest of the computer&#8217;s processes are incredibly fast &#8211; I rarely felt distracted or frustrated by the delays. Ahem. That is, until Photoshop was launched.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read several op-ed articles (and associating comments, thank you <a href="http://www.newsvine.com">Newsvine</a>) that both defend and blame Adobe for not updating their software to run natively on Macintels. One thing that is consistent throughout is the fact that Adobe had plenty of time to prepare for the switch, whether it was 6 or 9 or 12 months. Even if it had been 2 months, I still feel that such a huge transition in computing should be perceived as priority number one for any company that enjoys such a large user base from Mac owners and patrons. If you ask my opinion, Adobe sat on their huge (and growing), collective butt just to spite Apple &#8230; and it may end up biting them in that same butt.</p>

<p>The dilemma Adobe now faces is that they&#8217;ve said a universal (Intel-friendly) version of their software will not be available until CS3 is released, sometime in 2007. They said this way back when there were only two Intel Macs on the market and the world was still skeptical about Apple&#8217;s move &#8230; uh, just a few months ago. But a lot has changed since then. I don&#8217;t know the exact numbers, but based on reviews and my incredibly accurate observational skills, Apple&#8217;s sales of new Intel-based systems is quite good: Which isn&#8217;t so good for Adobe. Here&#8217;s what the a recent board meeting at Adobe could look like:</p>

<p><strong>Adobe-Head-Honcho #1:</strong> So, my teenage daughter just got herself a Macinbook or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #2:</strong> Yeah? Black or white?</p>

<p><strong>Geek Advisor:</strong> I think they&#8217;re called &#8220;MacBooks.&#8221;<br /></p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> I think she said white.</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #3:</strong> You know they&#8217;re charging like 400 bucks more for the black?</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #2: </strong>No way!</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> Oh yeah, she mentioned that. She asked me for a copy of  Photoshop for it.</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #2:</strong> I&#8217;ve got a copy right here. <em>(Pulls out a 95-pound box from the bookshelf and hands it to Honcho #1.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> You might want to hold off on giving her that, sir.</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> What? Why?</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #3:</strong> Yeah, I heard our software won&#8217;t run on those new MacTops.</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> What?!</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #2:</strong> That&#8217;s baloney! It runs just fine &#8211;</p>

<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> That&#8217;s not true, it runs, but &#8211;</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> Are you saying that my daughter can&#8217;t run #@$%ing <em>Photoshop</em> on her #@$%ing <em>Apple</em>?!</p>

<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #2:</strong> &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #3:</strong> &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Honcho #1:</strong> Crap.</p>

<p>If I were Adobe right now I&#8217;d be working my fingers to the bone getting a universal binary out. Why? Because of users like me &#8211; users that are about to upgrade their Mac and have only one reason to not do so. Users that are beginning to wonder if that reason is really such a big deal in the first place. Users that are starting to look for other tools that accomplish what Photoshop and Illustrator do (with probably less stress, for less money). Users that are crossing their fingers in hope that Apple will introduce a &#8220;Photoshop killer&#8221; (or something truly ground-breaking, like a graphic design app that&#8217;s actually intuitive!).</p>

<p>I doubt Adobe is working on little more than rearranging their offices to make room for their new Macromedia friends right now, though. I know this must be true because I&#8217;ve got this nagging Adobe Updater thing that&#8217;s supposed to remind me when a new update is ready, and lately it&#8217;s been rather quiet. Whatever they&#8217;re working on over there it&#8217;s certainly not their current applications.</p>

<p>So in the meantime, what am I to do? I want to upgrade to a Macintel so bad I can taste it &#8230; and using the MacBook Pro lately hasn&#8217;t helped the situation. Compared to my PowerBook the Intel machine screams. I can only take so much of this speed and torture before I pack up &#8220;Caspian II&#8221; and post an eBay ad. Again, the only thing stopping me is Adobe.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/why_apple_missed_the_niche">Why Apple Missed The Niche</a></h2>
		<p>Apple missed an important demographic by introducing a consumer-level portable instead of a smaller professional portable: Me. 
I don&#8217;t dare assume I&#8217;m in the majority (of Apple consumers) by being a graphic designer and a [wannabe-]mobile-professional, but I&#8217;ll take some liberty in saying that I&#8217;m part of an influential niche market &#8211; one that&#8217;s been ignored by Apple&#8217;s recent offerings. Especially considering the very latest, the MacBook.</p>

<p>With a 13.3-inch, glossy, widescreen display, an Intel core-duo processor, and cool, showy features like the mag-safe power connector, built-in iSight camera, wireless remote, and motion sensor protector, the MacBook <em>seems</em> like a viable &#8220;upgrade&#8221; for me. I&#8217;m using a now-archaic 1.67GHz PowerBook G4, introduced not even than 18 months ago. So why does the potential upgrade feel like it would be more of a downgrade to me?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you why.</p>

<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m a professional; or at least I like to consider myself one. I design graphics and websites, and as such, use a computer as my primary tool. Technical requirements aside, <span class="pullquote alt">I demand a certain level of quality for my tool(s)</span>. The MacBook, though &#8220;designed by Apple in California&#8221;, does not meet that demand. It&#8217;s a <em>consumer</em> product, not a professional one. If feels cheaper, looks cheaper and <em>is</em> cheaper than my PowerBook.</p>

<p>Secondly, while it&#8217;s not directly the fault of Apple, the dilemma of Adobe not updating their products to run natively on the Intel processor means s-l-o-w performance from Photoshop on the MacBook (and MacBook Pro for that matter). Trust me, I know. I&#8217;ve managed to install and use Photoshop CS2 on a borrowed MacBook Pro. (That&#8217;s another story entirely.)</p>

<p>Finally, should I decide to order a MacBook, I will first have to sell my PowerBook &#8211; something I don&#8217;t want to do. Not that I&#8217;ve built some attachment to Caspain II (okay, maybe a <em>little</em> bit of sentiment), but I don&#8217;t think I could get near what it&#8217;s worth for it &#8230; to me. Similar models are getting between $1100 and $1300 on eBay; less than half what I paid for it just over a year ago.</p>

<p>So what could&#8217;ve Apple done to get me to upgrade (without hesitation)? A smaller than or 13.3-inch, ultra-portable, aluminum, backlit, duo-core, non-glossy, iSight-equipped, feature-laden, not-too-hot, no foam MacBook &#8230; called &#8220;The Macintosh ProBook&#8221;. And I suspect others in my demographic would follow me in throwing down their credit cards for something like that, too.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think the MacBook is a great product. &#8220;I Approve&trade;&#8221; it still, and will still recommend it for anyone considering. Apple nailed it when it comes to offering a near-perfect consumer portable, I doubt it not. There&#8217;s not a better laptop, PC or Mac or otherwise, in its price range or class. Bottom line: The MacBook rocks.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#8217;t rock <em>me</em>.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/macbooks">MacBooks</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, but Apple announced the successor to their iBook line of consumer portables on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook">the MacBook</a>. We knew this one was coming, but it&#8217;s still nice to see it happen &#8230; finally.</p>

<p>Speaking of finally, I took a break this afternoon/evening to head to my local Apple Store to get my grubby hands on one &#8211; a full DAY AND A HALF after they were announced. It felt like an eternity, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Impressions? Slick. Slick as in &#8220;not quite sexy, but still cool enough to make your PC friends drooly-jealous&#8221;. While the white variation is only slightly more cool than the original iBook, the black is exceptionally &#8220;slick&#8221;.</p>

<p>And yes, Martin. I Approve&trade;.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, I&#8217;m currently using and, in fact, writing this entry on a brand new, 2.0ghz MacBook Pro; and <em>loving</em> it. This thing really screams. Especially at the simple stuff like launching and switching apps, organizing files, surfing the web, etc.</p>

<p>So long story-short &#8211; I get to &#8220;borrow&#8221; it for 4-8 weeks while my wife&#8217;s laptop is being repaired by Fujitsu. Word to the wise: It pays to get the extended warranties on PC&#8217;s. ;)</p>

<p>Impressions, reviews and thoughts on the MBP later.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/that_which_needs_work">That Which Needs Work</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m not a negative person, so don&#8217;t let the latest of my writings fool you. Still, I&#8217;ve gotta get some of this stuff off my chest and I figure my blog is a good place to do that. You don&#8217;t mind do you? 
So, as pleased with the redesign as I am, there&#8217;s still some portions of <a href="http://www.thecity.org">the new TCC site</a> that have been left undone, frustrate me, or even make me cringe. Since most of my readership here are web developers, designers, or saavy web-surfers, I thought I&#8217;d lift the rug and show the dirty underneath &#8211; as a sort of behind-the-scenes, help-me-out-if-you-can, yes-I&#8217;m-human-too thing. So, without further ado &#8230;</p>

<p>That, of the TCC redesign, which needs work:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The favicon</strong>. Please. Have you ever SEEN a dumber favicon?</li>
<li><strong>The events calendar</strong>. I&#8217;ve had it with EasyPHPCalendar. I&#8217;m ready for Google Calendar&#8217;s API already. (<strong>Update</strong>: Okay so they&#8217;ve <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html">got an API</a>, now I just need someone to write an EE module for it.)</li>
<li><strong>Event registration</strong>. I don&#8217;t think ANY of the forms validate, and they&#8217;re all horribly built. And not only do I not have the time to fix them, I&#8217;m having to <em>add</em> to the mess with new registrations going up this weekend!</li>
<li><strong>IE&#8217;s rendering of list items and, more specifically, the footer</strong>. Where do I begin with this one? Why, oh why, does IE insist on adding whitespace to list items? Try as I may, I can&#8217;t seem to get the sitemap to appear correctly in IE. Then there&#8217;s the issue of the sitemap somehow dropping off/out of the footer area. ARGH!</li>
<li><strong>The members section</strong>. I had such high hopes for this section of the site &#8230; Where did April go, by the way?</li>
<li><strong>The events calendar</strong>. Yes, again. The list on the homepage of upcoming events is powered by the same system, which sucks even more when in displayed in &#8220;list mode&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of inline images</strong>. I think the site really lacks in the &#8220;this is what our church looks and feels like&#8221; department. We need a professional photographer on staff, for sure.</li>
<li><strong>Pastor&#8217;s Perspectives blog</strong>. I really wish I could&#8217;ve made this better than it is. Sure simple is good, but to me it just looks thrown together (uh, probably because it <em>was</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Print stylesheet</strong>. This one needs work mostly because <em>it doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. Ahem.</li>
<li><strong>RSS feed(s)</strong>. Again with the <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em> stuff. My goal here would be to have one main feed with literally everything on the site &#8211; audio archives, news, volunteer opportunities, comments, etc. &#8211; listed in reverse-chronological order. I think this may require some sort of not-yet-created module for EE, though. I&#8217;d also like to have singular feeds for each database.</li>
<li><strong>Ministries&#8217; profiles</strong>. The ministries page in the about section really needs work. Honestly, each and every ministry of the church could have it&#8217;s own website, as they&#8217;re all so active, impacting and important.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice anything else that needs work?</p>
