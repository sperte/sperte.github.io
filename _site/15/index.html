	<p>Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://tagboard.com">Tagboard</a> in Redmond, WA. I have over 20 years experience creating graphics, interfaces, presentations, and systems. While I have a wide gamut of tactical skills, I'm most proud of my strengths as a team leader and manager.</p>

	<p>In 2009, I co-founded a company called <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon</a> with two of my colleagues. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time, and have a user install base of over 300,000. Our most popular app is a quick-launch video camera, called Capture.</p>

	<p>In 2011, I left my career of almost 13 years to co-found Tagboard, a social media curation platform based on the hashtag. As Chief Product Officer, my role is to help lead and drive the product roadmap.</p>

	<p>Below is my blog.</p>

<p>Yeah, they knew what they were doing. Happy Birthday, iPod. You&#8217;ve become an icon.</p>

Factor in the occasional toffee almond bar, and I&#8217;m spending an average of $5 every time I have a coffee craving in the middle of the day. What&#8217;s worse, lately, since we&#8217;ve run out of coffee for my barista machine at home<sup>1</sup>, I&#8217;ve been visiting the big SB in the mornings as well.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s with an aching wallet and bruised checking account that I whipped up this desktop picture &#8211; designed to sit as a reminder that, yes, gasoline for your body costs more than gasoline for your car.</p>

<p>At the risk of lawsuit and/or not-friendliness from the coffee corp itself, I now offer it to you, the world. Why? Because I care.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
