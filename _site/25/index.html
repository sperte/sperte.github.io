		<h2><a href="/entry/one_more_thing_or_three_or_four">One more thing ... or three, or four</a></h2>
		<p>After two days of thought-gathering, I&#8217;ve made some conclusions to my reactions of Apple&#8217;s announcements on Wednesday. In short, I believe they&#8217;re on the right track with the iMac, new iPod supporting video and upgrades to the iTunes Music Store. However, a closer look at what was revealed this week shows some interesting, and perhaps frustrating side affects. 
Let&#8217;s go in order of the announcements, ala Steve&#8217;s three-act presentation.</p>

<h3>Act I: The iMac G5</h3>

<p>First of all, I&#8217;m a big fan of the iMac G5 &#8211; and have been since it was introduced last year about this time. If I needed/wanted a home computer, I would choose it, hands-down, no questions asked. The upgrade announced (and released &#8211; way to go, Apple) is well worth the fanfare and excitement. I think the Front Row app is definitely a step in the right direction for Apple&#8217;s &#8220;digital lifestyle.&#8221; The increased specs, decreased dimensions, and matching pricepoint puts the new iMac in perfect position for the holidays. They&#8217;ll sell, alright &#8230; they&#8217;ll sell to students.</p>

<p>Despite what Steve Jobs said in the presentation, the Front Row application isn&#8217;t perfect for enjoying your Mac from your couch. No, the perfect environment for the iMac is going to be the close quarters, and shared rooms of the college student. Every dorm room in the nation should have an iMac G5 with Front Row running. It&#8217;s a match made in heaven &#8211; a [simple] remote to control music, DVD&#8217;s, music videos, photos, etc. &#8220;from your bed&#8221; (or bean-bag chair or futon) not &#8220;from your couch&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Act II: The new iPod</h3>

<p>Note that this is not an &#8220;iPod video&#8221; but just &#8220;iPod.&#8221; Smart, I think, of Apple to drop the functional naming convention. &#8220;Mini&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8221; work because they&#8217;re descriptive names for the device itself, not for what it does. You know, there&#8217;s some [CSS] lesson in here, but I can&#8217;t seem to <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2005/02/23/keep-your-classes-clean/">put my finger on it</a>.</p>

<p>I think Apple&#8217;s right on time delivering an iPod that &#8220;does video.&#8221; Too early (last year) would&#8217;ve robbed the podcasting movement of its glory and introduction, too late (next year) and the market would have already been too saturated. It&#8217;s perfect right now, though, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a/the evolutionary step for the iPod</li>
<li>Everyone wanted it</li>
<li>H.264 is gaining popularity (because &#8230;)</li>
<li>QuickTime 7 for Windows has been released</li>
</ol>

<p>The design of the new iPod is genius. Then again, did we expect anything less? I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t veer too far from the original design, keeping the clickwheel and layout of the previous model(s). I&#8217;m also glad they offer it in black. I don&#8217;t think the black model will sell as well (ratio-wise) as its smaller counterpart (the black nano), but it&#8217;ll still be the more popular choice. I want the white 60GB &#8211; uh, thinner than the previous 20GB model? Where do I swipe my card?</p>

<p>Some other points of interest with the new iPod:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard 320x240 screen resolution: Nice!</li>
<li>Moved headphone jack: I like.</li>
<li>No FireWire: &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#42;crickets&#42;</li>
</ul>

<p>A moment of silence for FireWire &#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an interesting irony: FireWire&#8217;s shining grace (video) has finally found its place in the iPod featureset &#8211; only to be ignored. With the new (video) iPod, Apple has officially abandoned FireWire support on its entire iPod line of products. FireWire is now the <em>bastard child</em>, having been forsaken by its creator. And for USB 2.0?! I can only assume it&#8217;s a decision based on Windows users&#8217; preferences. Ugh. Again, let&#8217;s pause in remembrance &#8230;</p>

<h3>Act III: iTunes 6</h3>

<p>Remember <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/seansperte/entry/nano_nano/">how I said</a> iTunes 5 barely deserved its versioning? Well I must&#8217;ve hit a nerve! Apple high-ups read my post and decided to stuff it to me by releasing a minuscule update and jumping an <strong>entire number version</strong>. As <a href="http://www.daringfireball.com">Gruber</a> said, &#8220;<span class="pullquote alt">iTunes 5 we hardly knew you</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the changes to the iTunes app (not the Music Store), shall we?</p>

<ol>
<li>A video icon now appears in the source list</li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. That&#8217;s it. No new preferences, no new layouts, no new interface, no new features. I&#8217;m sure a lot changed under the hood, but that&#8217;s what dot-numbers are for! <em>I would have been fine with 5.5 even!</em></p>

<p>Bottom line: It was the <strong>Music Store</strong> that received the big update this week, and not the iTunes app itself. So let&#8217;s talk about that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gifting: Way cool, long overdue, will be a huge holiday hit</li>
<li>Just For You: Personality comes to the Music Store, it&#8217;s about time</li>
<li>User reviews: Much needed, another way to drive personality, expect to see a lot of my reviews on there</li>
<li>Music Videos: Weren&#8217;t these already available?</li>
<li>Video shorts: Saw &#8216;em on the DVD special features already, got the t-shirt, what else you got?</li>
<li>TV: The &#8220;one more thing,&#8221; I&#8217;ll talk about that next</li>
</ul>

<p>iTunes is no longer just tunes, and neither is the Music Store just music. In my opinion, iTunes 6 should have never been released, and iTunes should have died at version 5. iMedia, iLibrary, iEntertainment, iDon&#8217;tCare &#8230; The app and store should&#8217;ve been renamed and refocused. Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s too hard to rebrand or revamp a product line. It&#8217;s not. Not for Apple. This version 6 crap is basically just laziness.</p>

<p>(I bet most of 1 Infinite Loop has probably had their office lights on 24-7 for the past 9-12 months. There&#8217;s no doubt those guys work hard, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m saying here.)</p>

<h3>The &#8220;one more thing &#8230;&#8221;</h3>

<p>Unlike the new iPod supporting video, I think the TV thing is a little out of place &#8211; and time. I think it&#8217;s a tad too early.</p>

<p>When you look at the success of the iTunes Music Store, you can immediately attribute it to the popularity of music downloads. At the time the Music Store was first introduced, illegal music downloading was at its peek (Napster, KaZaa, anyone?). The Music Store was Apple&#8217;s cure to the disease and the record labels (that dared) took a chance which paid off. The RIAA also began going after people, which scared &#8216;em, and forced them to use the iTMS if they wanted to continue to download songs.</p>

<p>TV is <em>not</em> being downloaded like music yet (note: if you&#8217;re reading my blog, chances are you&#8217;re a geek and you are the exception to this point). There&#8217;s no doubt it will be someday, because the idea is amazing &#8211; it&#8217;s just not mainstream yet.</p>

<p>Apple is taking a risk, as they often do. By providing the device and interface with which to download shows, they&#8217;re creating the vacuum in hopes that it will get filled automagically by default. They&#8217;re counting on networks&#8217; agreement in the pricing structure and delivery method. They&#8217;re banking on previous successes with music record labels &#8230; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000470040316/">which could be argued</a>. And they&#8217;re assuming the public doesn&#8217;t care about the quality of playback as much as the availablity of content. (Which I think may be a safe assumption.)</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m wrong. Maybe the very thing TV download needs is Apple&#8217;s push. It&#8217;s working for podcasts, right?</p>

<p>Still, until NBC, CBS, Fox and other big hitters in television come on board and start offering their content, I see little room to celebrate this new &#8220;feature.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Finale</h3>

<p>Apple is a unique company in that they never do anything blase. The announcements on Wednesday were so much more than a strategic holiday offering (though they were that as well). The new iMac with Front Row, the video iPod and the increased featureset in the iTunes Music (and video) Store are exciting, pacesetting offerings that should change the way we enjoy our &#8220;digital lifestyle.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited for them. I&#8217;m excited for me too, I guess. Even though I don&#8217;t plan on getting an iMac or downloading any TV shows soon, I&#8217;m definitely going to get a new iPod (when cases are released). They continue to change the world in which I live, and I continue to alter my habits to conform. I love it.</p>

<h3>Encore</h3>

<p>TV shows I&#8217;d be excited to download, with or without an iPod to play them on:</p>

<ul>
<li>CSI (Vegas)</li>
<li>Star Trek: TNG</li>
<li><a href="http://www.suerabeaux.com/techtv/">The Screensavers</a></li>
<li>The Apprentice</li>
<li>Simpsons</li>
<li>Seinfeld</li>
<li>Frasier</li>
<li>plus all the oldies like Cosby Show, Growing Pains, Family Matters, Full House, etc.</li>
</ul>

		<h2><a href="/entry/big_week">Big week</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m anticipating a big week. Sony Ericsson will probably unveil some new phones (I&#8217;m holding out for the &#8220;Sakura&#8221;) and Apple has something up their sleeve for Wednesday. I&#8217;ve sold my Treo (unsure of the future of Palm OS, not to mention the entire company), so I&#8217;ve got a nice chunk of cash with which to get myself a new phone. The Wife&trade; continues to be amazed how I come up with the money needed to support my gadget fetish.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

		<p>I personally don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see the video iPod introduced next Wednesday, but apparently <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,171396,00.html">everyone</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9597131/">else</a> <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/bbc-6-music-report-video-ipod-set-to-debut-in-london-next-week/">does</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/foxnews_videoipod.jpg" width="391" height="200" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Whatever. I&#8217;m not going to get excited until I see the iPhone from Apple (not Motorola, or Samsung, or NEC, or Sony Ericsson, or anyone else!).</p>

<p>(On second thought, I&#8217;d be excited about a camera iPod, I guess.)</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/check_uncheck_multiple_items_in_itunes_v5">Check/uncheck multiple items in iTunes (v5)</a></h2>
		<p>Just in time for the holiday season, Apple&#8217;s finally addressed the horrible UI shortcoming of multiple song management in iTunes. It used to be (versions prior to 5) that you had to manually check and uncheck songs <em>individually</em>. This proved a massive dilemma when enabling or disabling Christmas music or spoken-word content.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/itunes_checkselection.jpg" width="234" height="203" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Now, however, iTunes allows multiple songs to be checked or unchecked using the contextual menu. Just highlight the songs you&#8217;d like to manage, right-click (or control+click) and select either &#8220;Check Selection&#8221; or &#8220;Uncheck Selection&#8221;. This will prove to be one of my favorite new features of version 5.</p>

<p>When December hits, I&#8217;ll be ready with my holiday music.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/dye_brasso_dye">30 September 2005</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/dye_brasso_dye">Dye, Brasso, Dye!</a></h2>
		<p>So I bought myself (big shout-out to The Wife&trade; for the approval) an <a href="http://www.theinvisibleshield.com/ipod_nano_screen_protector.html">invisibleSHIELD</a> for my iPod nano. The demo video on their website sold me. Watch it, if you&#8217;ve got time. 
A couple of days go by and it finally came in the mail. I was expecting something more for some reason, but the package was literally just a standard-sized envelop with the shield inside. It came with a little tiny piece of paper that said to go to a specific URL for application instructions. I had already done my homework, though, so I wasn&#8217;t surprised to find out that in order to apply the shield you must use a soapy-water mixture.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2005/GearNGadgets/September2005/RDMGG_InvisibleShieldFirstLook.htm">testimony of others</a> who have done this seemed to be favorable, I decided it would be no big deal to endanger my nano for the cause. After all, I <em>am</em> protecting it, right?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s rewind for just a second, though, because earlier that day I had been reading up on all the complaints from nano owners about the scratch-prone casing. <span class="pullquote">I, for one, am among those who feel the nano scratches entirely too easily</span> &#8211; I believe mine was scratched up mostly by air particles and the hot and cold air mixture here in Seattle. It&#8217;s insane. I found one particular blog with a potential remedy to the problem: Brasso.</p>

<p>Apparently a small application of Brasso rubbed in thoroughly will remove the scratches from the screen. Wow! This guy&#8217;s story seemed legit and he has pictures too. Perfect! I thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to remove any scratches I had on my nano <em>before</em> actually putting on the invisibleSHIELD! Of course, I had The Wife&trade; double-check the guy&#8217;s blog for validity and she gave me the go ahead to buy the $4 can of Brasso. I went to work on my nano.</p>

<p>A half-hour later my pure, white iPod nano was now more of a yellowish, white nano. Granted, the scratches were all gone. Okay, so maybe I didn&#8217;t rub the Brasso out all the way &#8230; No, that wasn&#8217;t it because another half-hour later and it was still off-color. Okay, time to check the blog again. I read and reread the guy&#8217;s entry and it didn&#8217;t mention anything about discoloration. Since he had a black nano, though, it was safe to assume he didn&#8217;t notice any. I commented on his blog and kept trying to rub the Brasso off.</p>

<p>SITE NOTE: A less-than-informed commenter (not the author) on the blog happened to spew off some inappropriate words towards me claiming I was lazy and rude for commenting about my experience, hence the reason I have not linked to the entry. Feel free to Google it out, if curious.</p>

<p>I resolved to assume the best, put on the invisibleSHIELD and hope the white would somehow return, or the yellow wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought.</p>

<p>My experience putting on the shield went much like the story from the <a href="http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2005/GearNGadgets/September2005/RDMGG_InvisibleShieldFirstLook.htm">Rainy Day Magazine entry</a>. It took me three tries to get the front shield placed properly. It was really hard justifying getting soapy-water all over the front of the iPod. The back shield went on easier &#8211; either by design or because I had already learned the method of application. Drying time was 2 hours, but by then it was already midnight, so I just went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote alt">I was depressed, though, because I had a yellowish white iPod</span>, and though it was now protected, it was ugly. Why did the Brasso dye the acrylic? Should I have rubbed even longer and harder? I already felt as if I was rubbing <em>off</em> the casing. I supposed it wouldn&#8217;t matter anymore, since I would no longer have to baby it anyway because it had the shield on. I would just throw it around now, and not care about it.</p>

<p>I woke up the next morning and checked the status: Still yellowish. The shield was great though. I could barely notice it was there except for feel. Visibly, it was truly <em>invisible</em>. So, I had a protected, scratchless, yellowish iPod nano. The Wife&trade; was very sympathetic, but I wasn&#8217;t being consoled. It was a sad day &#8211; until I got to work.</p>

<p>It was about halfway through my morning when I noticed the iPod was &#8211; how should I say this? &#8211; &#8220;wigging out.&#8221; It was randomly changing tracks, rewinding and turning off and on the backlight &#8211; all without me touching the thing. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, because I thought it too. The water.</p>

<p>Great, <span class="pullquote">so now I had a protected, scratchless, yellowish, <em>disfunctional</em> iPod nano!</span></p>

<p>I called the store I bought it from and asked if they&#8217;d take it back. Of course, they said no. It was a shot in the dark. Then I thought I&#8217;d better try all the problem solving solutions that normally work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebooting. Didn&#8217;t work &#8211; it just flicked the backlight on and off again. Odd. I realized the problem was definitely hardware then. Nevertheless, I tried</li>
<li>Restoring the software. It seemed to fix the problem for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Smacking. Hey, sometimes technology needs a little jolt. I had the protector screen on it anyway, right? I smacked it, no help.</li>
<li>Can-of-air. Okay, so let&#8217;s try drying it out &#8211; if that&#8217;s really the cause of the disfunction. Again, no help.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that was the low-point. I started to consider selling the thing on eBay for parts. It was ruined already, so I removed the protective shielding to see if maybe the yellow tint would somehow come off with it. You know, it actually <em>did</em>, kind of.</p>

<p>It was at that moment I had a thought: AppleCare. Of course, AppleCare doesn&#8217;t cover customer abuse or cosmetic issues, but mine was (ahem) &#8220;wigging out.&#8221; Maybe, just maybe, they&#8217;d swap it out &#8211; or at the very least, send it in for repair. I thought I&#8217;d just try.</p>

<p>I made an appointment at the Genius Bar online and headed to my local Apple Store. On the way I prayed (yes, I pray about these things) that they&#8217;d not ask any pointed questions, and that I wouldn&#8217;t have to lie about it. I certainly wasn&#8217;t out to rip off Apple, but I did feel somewhat ripped off myself for buying a product that had scratched so easily. I rehearsed the possible scenarios in my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Best case: Easy swap-out.</li>
<li>Most likely: Send it in for repair (which wasn&#8217;t so bad since I had a shuffle that I could use in its stead).</li>
<li>Worse case: &#8220;Sorry, fella, nothing I can do about that.&#8221; After that, I was eBay-bound, for sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>I arrived and had to wait a few minutes so I compared the nano color to the display models. I was surprised to find that my nano wasn&#8217;t too much different. It just looked more used (yes, more used than the <em>display models</em>, which get handled a lot).</p>

<p>They called my name and at the bar he read my description of the problem (to himself). &#8220;So, we gotta nano that&#8217;s &#8216;wigging out,&#8217; eh?&#8221; he chuckled. I answered and handed him my nano. He played with it for a little and I narrarated the problems. &#8220;See, it doesn&#8217;t even reboot if you hold down the menu and select buttons,&#8221; I pointed out. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>What happened next totally reminded me of the scene in <em>Meet the Parents</em> where Greg is trying to get a ticket home and the lady behind the airliner desk is just pounding the keys on the keyboard, almost insanely. The guy took literally 5 minutes entering in data.</p>

<p>I finally broke down and asked, &#8220;so we gonna send it in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;ll just swap it out here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">Inside I was leaping up and down and I think I heard the Hallelujah praise chorus</span>. I had to continue the ignorant, uninformed customer facade though: &#8220;Oh, but I didn&#8217;t bring my box and stuff it came with &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the only thing we swap is the unit itself,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, okay, cool,&#8221; I said. &#8220;So do I have to pay anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope, it&#8217;s covered under the warranty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sweet! I walked out with a brand new (&#8220;replacement part&#8221;) iPod nano! Somewhere, some poor Apple technician is opening up my iPod wondering what&#8217;s wrong and is probably going to find just condensation.</p>

<p>So, the moral of the story? I don&#8217;t really know &#8211; but I haven&#8217;t taken the new iPod out of the plastic wrapping yet, and don&#8217;t plan on doing so until I can get a none-water-needing-to-appy case for it. Until then, I&#8217;ll use my shuffle.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/key_control">Key control</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for the perfect keystroke controller for iTunes. Name it and I&#8217;ve tried it; probably twice, actually. I think I&#8217;ve finally settled on Sizzling Keys from <a href="http://www.yellowmug.com/" title="Yellow Mug">Yellow Mug</a>. Here&#8217;s why &#8230; 
I have a simple set of needs for an iTunes controller:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quick and efficient to setup and use</li>
<li>Free or cheap (under $10)</li>
<li>Nice-looking (Apple-esque)</li>
<li>Virtually transparent to user (no buttons, extra controller, doesn&#8217;t take up screen real estate, etc.) &#8211; what do I need extra buttons for if I&#8217;ve got iTunes?</li>
<li>Ability to rate songs</li>
</ol>

<p>While many of the shareware options out there do meet these needs, they do so either with a (relatively) high price tag, or at the cost of performance. I&#8217;ve tried Synergy, iMote, Barquee, ByteController, and others. Each fell short in one area or another and caused me to continue my search.</p>

<p>I remember trying Sizzling Keys a long time ago when it was first released &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t impressed. Now, however, it&#8217;s at version 1.6.2, and I think it&#8217;s got just enough polish and punch to warrant a Sean-Sperte-stamp-of-approval.</p>

<p>Truth be told, Sizzling Keys could still use some help in the interface design department. The floater fonts and graphics have a horrible shadow, and the preference pane icon and controls are ugly as sin.</p>

<p>What I like best about it, though, is the ability to set so many different keystrokes to so many different iTunes options. There&#8217;s an option to hide/show iTunes, one to bring up a search floater, and another to &#8220;almost mute&#8221; the audio.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a good iTunes controller, I recommend <a href="http://www.yellowmug.com/sk4it/">Sizzling Keys</a>. There&#8217;s a lot of bang for your buck &#8230; oh, yeah: I forgot to mention it&#8217;s <strong>FREE</strong>!</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/nano_sales">Nano sales</a></h2>
		<p>Despite what <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10793_3-5870633.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5870633&amp;subj=news">the media are reporting</a> I assure you, iPod nano sales are going well. I know this because I was unable to get one until a full 10 days after they were announced and made available. I had been actively (read: &#8220;multiple times per day&#8221;) calling every Apple Store and electronics store in the area asking if they had the 4GB model in stock. I was on several &#8220;call lists&#8221; and also noticed the ship delay go from 2-3 days to 5-7 days on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/store">Apple website</a>.</p>

<p>I actually noticed this discrepancy in the news last week; some reported sales as going well, some as not-so-good. I even commented to a friend about it. The bottom line (to consumers) is that the nano is selling, and selling fast. If you want one (and who doesn&#8217;t?), then you&#8217;ve got to be fast and furious.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/pluses_and_minuses_of_nano_ownership">Pluses and minuses of nano ownership</a></h2>
		<p>After a day of nano ownership, here&#8217;s (the first of) my inevitable review(s).</p>

<p>The pluses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazing screen &#8211; it literally looks like paper, and works well in direct sunlight</li>
<li>USB 2.0 is super-fast; noticeable faster than FireWire, for some reason</li>
<li>Menu access is faster than previous models</li>
<li>Sound-quality is great</li>
</ul>

<p>The minuses (mostly with iTunes):</p>

<ul>
<li>Can&#8217;t leave the nano in the source list (as you can with the shuffle)</li>
<li>When using the Manually Update option, you must manually update songs you&#8217;ve changed (e.g. by adding album art), which means you can easily create duplicates</li>
<li>Similarly, &#8220;Show duplicate songs&#8221; isn&#8217;t supported within the iPod songlist</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a magnet for fingerprints and scratches (com&#8217;on Apple, get those cases shipping!)</li>
</ul>
