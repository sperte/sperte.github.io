		<h1>Tagboard Brand</h1>
		<h2>The pressure was on to create a visual identity that would both establish and distinguish us in the market — and it had to stand the test of time.</h2>

	<h2 id="type-face-and-mark">Type, face, and mark</h2>

<p>Research for the brand started months earlier as I surveyed various visual elements from across the technology industry, mostly from consumer brands and companies. I knew I wanted to create a simple brand that included the name in the logo – a logotype – but also recognized the need to have a strong icon or mark.</p>

<p>After test driving a bunch of typefaces and logotype combinations, I landed on a modified version of the brand name set in <a href="https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/seravek/">Seravek</a>, from the same foundry as the Facebook font, <a href="https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/">Klavika</a>. It satisfied the requirements of being familiar and friendly but was also customizable and felt high-brow.</p>

<p>I also created an icon mark that integrated the hash symbol and Seravek’s lowercase “T”.</p>

<h2 id="color-codified">Color codified</h2>

<p>As part of my research I also looked into color cognition and response. I knew color is an extremely important part of establishing a lasting and strong brand, and I determined although the blue-green spectrum of the wheel was overcrowded, breaking convention just for the sake of being unique wasn’t wise, especially given the type of emotional reactions we wanted to engage – things like friendliness, accessibility, ease of use, etc.</p>

<p>I created a base color scheme that included primary and secondary/accent colors that translated well (or mostly well) across mediums.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-brand-back-together">Getting the brand back together</h2>

<p>As part of the process I developed a presentation slide deck to help anchor the story arch while pitching (and eventually educating) internally. Later, I expanded the brand scope to include things like communication policies and non-visual elements.</p>

<h2 id="powered-by-tagboard">Powered by Tagboard</h2>

<p><img src="poweredby-blue.png" data-action="zoom" /></p>

<p>The logo itself was integrated into an attribution badge to help viewers identify Tagboard’s public screens. It actually became an important part of our partnership strategy with source networks like Twitter and Facebook because if a public social screen had our logo it meant the content being shown was sanctioned. And despite early push-back from customers, the “Powered by Tagboard” badge eventually became a sort of badge of honor, signaling a company’s forward-thinking and taste. (Tagboard has a reputation of having the best looking and most natural social screens).</p>
