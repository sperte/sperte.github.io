	<p>Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://tagboard.com">Tagboard</a> in Redmond, WA. I have over 20 years experience creating graphics, interfaces, presentations, and systems. While I have a wide gamut of tactical skills, I'm most proud of my strengths as a team leader and manager.</p>

	<p>In 2009, I co-founded a company called <a href="http://skyballoonstudio.com">Sky Balloon</a> with two of my colleagues. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time, and have a user install base of over 300,000. Our most popular app is a quick-launch video camera, called Capture.</p>

	<p>In 2011, I left my career of almost 13 years to co-found Tagboard, a social media curation platform based on the hashtag. As Chief Product Officer, my role is to help lead and drive the product roadmap.</p>

	<p>Below is my blog.</p>

Sure, other kids could shoot three-pointers, play the piano and do the rumba, but I could pull off stuff with a controller they hadn&#8217;t even dreamed of [&#8230;]  What happened to the old days, when I&#8217;d beat a Madden first-timer by 72 points?&#8221;</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/wii_all_love_to_play">Wii All Love to Play</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/wiimote.jpg" border="0" height="235" width="220" alt="Nintendo's Wiimote" align="right" />Nintendo has brought the &#8220;play&#8221; back to &#8220;gameplay&#8221; with their new game console, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_wii">Nintendo Wii</a> (pronounced &#8220;we&#8221;). I had the privilege of playing the Wii system at a private pre-release party two days before it was released to the public, and since then I&#8217;ve been trying to come up with ways to get my own. 
It&#8217;s really everything you&#8217;d want in a gaming system. For those who aren&#8217;t up on such things, here&#8217;s a quick overview of the Wii&#8217;s most notable features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nintendo&#8217;s 5th generation game console</li>
<li>Small, light-weight, sexy design</li>
<li>Plays both GameCube and Wii games via its slot-loading disc drive</li>
<li>Standard-definition, progressive component video (via optional, additional cable)</li>
<li>Standard SD card support (up to 2 GB) for photos, videos, game data, etc.</li>
<li>Wireless controllers use Bluetooth and infrared, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote">Wii Remote</a> or Wiimote</li>
<li>Wiimote has three-dimensional motion sensitivity to interact with games in a 3D space</li>
<li>Wiimote has speaker for directional/dimensional sound</li>
<li>Wiimote has vibration feedback</li>
<li>Games cost anywhere between $20&ndash;$45</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bringing us together</h3>

<p>The aspect of the Wii that really excites me isn&#8217;t all those features, though. I think the absolute best strength of the Wii has to do with its ability to appeal to not just the geek or gamer, but the <em>kid</em> in us &#8230; all.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/wiimotion/pool">Flickr photo pool called Wii Motion</a>. In that group you&#8217;ll find dozens of photos of people playing Wii &#8211; people from every generation, culture, background, and race.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tm22/306763906/in/pool-wiimotion/">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtg/306853238/in/pool-wiimotion/">this one</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pardeepsingh/302937661/in/pool-wiimotion/">this one</a>, and the show stopper (tear-jerker): <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mattandcarla/302002995/in/pool-wiimotion/">This one</a> of a brother born with cerebral palsy playing baseball with his sister. Wow, Nintendo, get that family on a commercial or something.</p>

This could be the straw the broke the camels back for me. I&#8217;ve been wanting to drop .Mac for years now, but always lemented that my Apple ID would have to remain my mac.com email address. [UPDATE: Scratch that. It seems that .Mac users still cannot change their ID.]</p>
