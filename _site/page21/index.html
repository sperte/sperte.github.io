    <p><img src="/assets/img/minimize.jpg" width="138" height="83" alt="" class="imgleft" />We all know that if you want to minimize a window in OS X, all you need to do is hit cmd+m, right? But what if you want to <em>un</em>-minimize a window? Is there no hot-key, hack, or software tool that enables this?</p>

    <h2><a href="/2006/02/11/intel_shmintel.html">Intel shmintel</a></h2>
    <p>I stopped by my local Mac Store today &#8211; no, not the Apple Store, the <a href="http://www.thecomputerstore.com ">Mac Store</a>. I almost wish I wouldn&#8217;t have. 
While browsing the myriad of iPod accessories they had displayed I overheard a gentleman ask one of the employees if they had any MacBook&#8217;s in stock. The female employee, who I could tell was fond of herself talking, replied by giving a long, innacurate summary of the MacBook Pro and what it is; finally answering that they did indeed have one in stock, in the back. This is where my interest was piqued and I stopped pretending not to hear &#8211; I turned and looked at the employee dead-on.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not allowed to put it out until Apple does,&#8221; she said, I guess implying that they have to wait for the Apple Store to put it out first &#8230; ? I rolled my eyes and went back to browsing. I could tell her knowledge went about as deep as the Finder help menu.</p>

<p>&#8220;So can I see it now?&#8221; the customer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks just like the previous PowerBook,&#8221; another (male) employee joined the conversation. &#8220;But they just have the 15-inch version right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise, it&#8217;s the exact same,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It feels the same, looks the same &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, besides the iSight!&#8221; laughed the female employee.</p>

<p>I guess you had to be there, but at this point I realized these employees were, in fact, idiots. I felt really sorry for the guy who asked the question. They obviously didn&#8217;t have a MacBook and just wanted to &#8220;sell&#8221; the guy on one.</p>

<p>Anyway, they went on to tell the gentleman that they did, in fact, have a 17&#8221; Intel-iMac on the show-floor that he could look at. They pointed it out, and after a few minutes of playing around on it, the guy went about his way. I hoped on and double-checked to make sure it was an Intel machine. It was!</p>

<p>All I have to say is, <em>Intel shmintel</em>. The &#8220;noticable&#8221; speed difference wasn&#8217;t there. I don&#8217;t know what <a href="http://macbreak.com/">Leo and Amber</a> were testing at MacWorld when they reported such amazing performance &#8211; it certainly wasn&#8217;t the same model I was on. Then again, having recently upgraded to a dual-core G5 machine I&#8217;ve probably become a little spoiled.</p>

<p>Okay, I admit, I&#8217;ve <em>definitely</em> become a little spoiled.</p>

<p>Still, I was expecting more &#8211; you know, because of all the &#8220;4x faster&#8221; hype Apple has been pushing. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait for the &#8220;real world&#8221; benchmarks, and the MacBook Pro&#8217;s release, to see if this Intel business is what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.</p>

    <p>I celebrated my 25th birthday Tuesday. Besides a ton of text messages and ecards, it was a pretty uneventful day as far as celebrating. <em>However</em>, The Wife&trade; finally caved and let me get a Sony PSP for my birthday, even though she still says that only &#8220;yucky boys&#8221; have them. (Not that I disagree, I would just like to help change that demographic with <em>my</em> ownership.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/psp_macro.jpg" width="300" height="104" alt="Photo of my new Sony PSP" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I wish I had time to do a full review, but that will have to wait. The bottom line? Winner. Hands-down, the PSP is a solid piece of hardware.</p>

<p>In the meantime, are there any essential games are peripherals I should get? (I only have Wipeout Pure so far, but LOVE it.)</p>

    <h2><a href="/2006/01/20/gcv4_part_2.html">GCv4: Part 2</a></h2>
    <p>In <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/index.php/geekandmild/entry/gcv4_part_1/">Part 1</a> of this series I shared how the new <a href="http://www.generationchurch.org">Generation Church website</a> was launched. This time I&#8217;d like to tell how the design came to be and how I created the elements. The goal here is inspire and educate other graphic designers. Hopefully this helps you.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wicked_worn.jpg" width="175" height="110" class="imgright" />It&#8217;s not hard to tell where I got the inspiration for the GC site from. That &#8220;<a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000045.html">Wicked Worn</a>&#8221; look, although seemingly trendy (and possibly even passé), has always been a favorite style of mine. Not only is it unique, but it also communicates a level of attention to detail (ATD) that isn&#8217;t found in a lot of other styles. Some examples of inspiration (but not necessarily recommendation):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/">Urban Outfitters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tnvacation.com/">Tennessee Vacation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.redlabor.com/">Red Labor</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.matthew-design.com/index.php/">Matthew Almand</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.leftfordead.org/unsentletters/">Unsent Letters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.powazek.com/">Derek Powazek</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.baguettebox.com/">Baguette Box</a></li>
</ul>

<p>See? I told you it ain&#8217;t hard to see where I got it from (honorable mention goes to <a href="http://www.sean-johnson.com/">Sean Johnson</a> for the super-fly background graphic idea).</p>

<h3>Continuity</h3>

<p>In addition to external inspiration, I also took a lot from GC&#8217;s own branding graphics, which were already in affect. Every week GC meets in the main auditorium of <a href="http://www.thecity.org/">The City Church</a> and use the three main screens to display graphics and worship lyrics. The main graphic currently being used is where I got the masthead for the website:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/gcv4_splash_thumb.jpg" onclick="window.open('/assets/img/gcv4_splash.jpg','popup','width=735,height=555,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="/assets/img/gcv4_splash_thumb.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="imgcenter" /></a></p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/grime_brush.jpg" width="126" height="116" class="imgleft" />It&#8217;s true that much of the &#8220;feel&#8221; of the site has to do with the color palette and font choice, but it&#8217;s the finer things (shadows, textures, etc.) that are my favorite. I applied some of <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000024.html">the methods discussed in Cameron&#8217;s series</a>, but mainly stuck to the brush tool and used many of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=photoshop+brushes&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">thousands of free, high quality brushes</a> available on the web.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/brush_example1.jpg" width="201" height="74" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>To create the Wicked Worn look using brushes (which is, arguably the quickest, dirtiest &#8211; no pun intended &#8211; way) you simply &#8220;hand-draw&#8221; the worn effects you want. In order to maintain the ability to edit and to have the most flexibility (for scaling, morphing, etc.) I usually always use the brush tool in conjunction with layer masks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/brush_example2.jpg" width="213" height="193" class="imgright" />The first thing I do is create a new type layer. Font choice is always important; as is color, tracking, and style (or weight). Once I&#8217;m satisfied with the type, I add a new mask to the layer, select the brush tool and pick my brush. I have a library of hundreds of brush sets I&#8217;ve collected over the years. I keep them on an external hard drive and load one at a time when I need them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the brush tool</li>
<li>Show the brushes pallette</li>
<li>Open the palette menu &#8211; the circle icon (with the stemless arrow)</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Replace Brushes&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Navigate to the desired brush set</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a majority of Photoshop users who&#8217;ve never actually used the brush palette or tool in this way &#8211; so consider yourself enlightened. Consider that free, no charge.</p>

<p>Anyway, I like to see an outlined preview of the brush while I&#8217;m drawing (or, more accurately, clicking), so I always ensure the CAPS-LOCK is off. This will give you a preview of the brush (so long as there are defined edges), looking something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/brush_example3.jpg" width="202" height="90" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where finesse comes in handy. There&#8217;s a rule I go by whenever I create something: <strong>Just because you <em>can</em>, doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em></strong>. In other words, the key to the brush tool is finding a healthy balance of detail. Once I&#8217;ve found that balance, I stop and do what I should have done at every step:</p>

<p><strong>SAVE!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/brush_example4.jpg" width="205" height="71" class="imgright" />Now all that&#8217;s left is a little bit of layer effects. I usually add an inner shadow and/or drop shadow.</p>

<p class="update">To be continued.</p>
