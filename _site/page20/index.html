		<h1><a href="/">Geek &amp; Mild by Sean Sperte</a></h1>

		  <h2 id="intro">Hello. Welcome to the weblog of Sean Sperte. I've been posting my thoughts related to design, technology, and faith here since 2005.

    <h2><a href="/entry/productivity_at_its_best">Productivity at its Best</a></h2>
    <p>The latest issue of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> has an article about <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek">working less</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>But in the larger scheme of things, does that really matter? Will we lie on our death bed and say &#8220;Damn, I wish I would&rsquo;ve got more done at work?&#8221; I doubt it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know I won&#8217;t be saying anything remotely like that on my death bed. For one, I ain&#8217;t a cusser. Secondly, I believe I <em>work to live</em>, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Ryan Carson (yes, from <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/">Carson Workshops</a> and <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/">DropSend</a>) says that productivity is not a matter of time, but mentality. He and his wife decided to do something crazy to prove it: Work only four days a week.</p>

<p>It worked.</p>

<blockquote><p>We have more peace. More time to think. More time to enjoy life. It&rsquo;s fabulous.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds good to me, but I wonder if Mondays (my current day off) are supposed to provide that for me already.</p>

<p>Ryan also gives a couple practical pointers as well; things like don&#8217;t instant message, don&#8217;t keep your email client open, ask for alone-time, and make lists.</p>

<p>I lost count of how many times I&#8217;ve read these three things lately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t instant message</li>
<li>Get alone</li>
<li>Prioritize your projects (get organized)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think Jonathan Snook put it best when he said that productivity is like a stream train that takes a lot of energy to get moving &#8230; And once it&#8217;s derailed, you&#8217;ve not lost 5 minutes, but 30.</p>

<p class="update" style="clear: both;">So I guess it&#8217;s not the &#8220;revolution&#8221; anymore. Whatever. More interesting to me is the DS Lite, hitting stores June 11th for a mere $129.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/full_mailbox">Full mailbox</a></h2>
    <p>As if I needed a clearer picture of how busy my life is at the moment: The Wife&trade; and I returned home tonight from a church prayer meeting and (finally) checked our mailbox. (You know, the postal service one &#8230; by the side of the road &#8230; <em>non</em>-electronic.) It&#8217;s probably been a month since we last got the mail.</p>

<p>On top of the half-foot stack of mail was a friendly notice saying our mailbox was too full, and that all mail would be held (as of 3/22) at the local branch office for ten days; and after that, returned to sender. Yikes! Ten days from the notice is, uhm, <em>today</em>!</p>

<p>You want to know the irony of it all? The entire stack of mail we pulled tonight was, as you may have guessed, ALL JUNK MAIL.</p>

<p>So, not only was I reminded how busy we really are, but also how much I hate regular mail. The real question now is, do we actually <em>care</em> if all our mail is returned?</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/marsedit_testrun">MarsEdit testrun</a></h2>
    <p>I&#8217;m posting this entry from <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, a weblog client that runs locally on my laptop. I&#8217;m curious if this method of posting would enable (and/or force) me to blog more consistently. So far I&#8217;m really liking it. <del>One</del> <ins>A few</ins> of the benefits of using a desktop client &mdash; rather than the web-based control panel &mdash; is the Mac&#8217;s inline spell-check<ins>, on-the-go draft creation, and speed</ins>.</p>

<p>Anyway, (in true <a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/?p=3489">Joshua Blankenship form</a>) note to self: Plan to go to <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/?PHPSESSID=7f8eb386e7b1cb6071b7c6b793b6d566">SXSW</a> next year.</p>

<p class="update">Update: I&#8217;m loving MarsEdit and will probably end up purchasing it. The only problem I&#8217;ve had so far is uploading photos. The upload works just fine, but the placement of the photo in the entry doesn&#8217;t work. It just does nothing. Any advice?</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/friction_on_the_web">Friction on The Web</a></h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/authors/u/nickusborne" title="Go to Nick Usborne's A List Apart profile page">Nick Usborne</a> offers some great thoughts on how to maximize the potential for users to reach the goal of your website &mdash; interaction (to do something): <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flywheelsandfriction">Flywheels, Kinetic Energy, and Friction</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want someone to <em>do</em> something, you need to build what amounts to a funnel, or pathway. Help the reader identify the one thing they want, and then simplify and &#8220;narrow&#8221; the design and the text in order to focus on that one thing, and build energy and enthusiasm within the reader. Take away any distractions, visually or with words. Focus on the one thing.</p></blockquote>

<p>He uses the analogy of a flywheel in a child&#8217;s car toy; you know, the kind you rev&#8217; up and then let go? He suggests (and I agree) that users naturally lose energy from the friction of the process &#8230; the process of navigating, finding, searching, filling out, etc.</p>

<p>Applying this rule (friction vs. energy) is something I&#8217;m definitely going to pay attention to in my design process for my church. We frequently have events that require online registration, and it&#8217;s my goal to make the process as easy as possible for the least web-saavy in our congregation.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/abuse_of_power">Abuse of Power?</a></h2>
    <p>It was with great anticipation and enthusiasm that common-folk stopped doing their day jobs at 10AM PST today. We all tuned into our choice rumor site (those that could handle the stress) and eagerly awaited each update as they came in, play-by-play. We, to put it lightly, were let down. 
<img src="/assets/img/intel-mini.jpg" alt="The new Intel-based Mac mini" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Apple today introduced a new revision to their Mac mini computer, which now sports and Intel process (available in single and duo core). The Mac mini now comes in two flavors: Too-Expensive and Way-Too-Expensive. Meh.</p>

<p>They also revealed a boombox-like product for the iPod, called iPod Hi-Fi, also available in the Way-Too-Expensive category.</p>

<p>Let me ask a simple question here, fully knowing my audience of Apple-fans and geeks: Do you think Apple is abusing their power?</p>

<h3>An event? For this?</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/apple-event.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs unveiling the new Intel Mac mini" class="imgright" />Apple events are big. They&#8217;re, like, bigger than big. When Engadget.com goes down because of the stress on their server you know something&#8217;s big (not even <a href="http://ces.engadget.com/">CES</a> did that). There wasn&#8217;t one pre-event headline or article that didn&#8217;t call this event &#8220;big&#8221;. Even Leo Laporte (of the <a href="http://www.thisweekintech.com/">This Week in Tech</a> podcast) said it was supposed to be big.</p>

<p>Was it big event? No.</p>

<p>So if Apple knows their power in drawing the masses, why did they use it for such small offerings?</p>

<p>Caveat: Okay, I can understand the necessity for a Mr.-Jobs-himself reveal of the Intel Mac mini (or any Intel-based Mac). The move to Intel is a <em>huge</em> to <em>majorly huge</em> deal for Apple. Still, don&#8217;t you think it should have been the &#8220;one more thing &#8230;&#8221; or at least the last thing on the agenda? Instead it was the first. It was almost like they wanted to downplay the Mac mini and have it upstaged by the iPod Hi-Fi! (You think they actually <em>did</em> want that?)</p>

<h3>A hundred bucks? For that?</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/ipod-case.jpg" alt="Leather iPod case" class="imgleft" />In addition to the Mac minitel (minintel?), and the iPod Why?-Fi, Apple also graciously introduced a stunningly lame iPod leather case. Priced at an unbelievable $99, the case&#8217;s only qualifying features are a stamped Apple logo and &#8220;iPod&#8221; wording&mdash;and <em>maybe</em> the tab-pull thing. Again, meh.</p>

<p>I told a friend I would have likely purchased the case had it been priced at $29, and maybe heavily weighed the cost at $39. But for $99? I think we&#8217;re seeing some price-gouging going on.</p>

<h3>Media bias? What&#8217;s that?</h3>

<p>Steve Jobs &amp; Co. have clearly won the media over with their iPod and cool business strategies&mdash;<a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/link_cnet_hates_apple/">well, most of the media, anyway</a>. Columnists who wouldn&#8217;t pay Apple a second thought are now writing speculation about their future, almost endorsing their endeavors. Apple, once the forgotten dog, is now the underdog. And who doesn&#8217;t like rooting for the underdog?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll openly admit that my Apple-geekness causes my emotions to get all wound up when an event like today&#8217;s is announced. But when the general public, who three years ago said, &#8220;Apple-who?&#8221; join in the fray &#8230; let&#8217;s just conclude that Apple&#8217;s got some powerful influence and a lot going for them right now.</p>

<p>So, why, with everything going so well, does Apple pull a stunt like they did today? It was, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing product announcement(s) from Apple &#8230; ever. And not just because of the rumored video iPod, full-length films on iTunes, or other such speculations that surrounded the event. It&#8217;s a disappointment because Apple <em>held an event</em> for it.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>
