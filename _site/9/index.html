		<h2><a href="/entry/expression_engine_and_the_power_of_url_segments">ExpressionEngine and the Power of URL Segments</a></h2>
		<p>I <a href="http://blog.virb.com/entries/blog-import-feature-is-live">had need</a> today to serve a separated RSS feed of just my blog articles &#8211; sans links and quick-posts. At first I thought I&#8217;d simply duplicate my RSS template and call it something like <code>rss-blog.php</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah right. Not with ExpressionEngine and its support for URL segment conditionals around. Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention, because this is all it took: <code>if segment_3 != 'blog'</code></p>

<p>Now, the when the URL is <code>http://seansperte.com/rss/blog</code> I can show unique content by placing it inside the <code>if</code> statement, like so:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>weblog=&quot;blog1&#123;if segment_3 != &apos;blog&apos;&#125;|blog2&#123;/if&#125;&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>See how that works? See how easy?</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/what_is_twitter">What is Twitter?</a></h2>
		<p>[This article has been updated <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/07/friends-followers-and-notifications.html">after Twitter made some changes</a> to the semantics of their services, especially regarding &#8220;friends&#8221; and notifications.]</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/twitter-logo.jpg" border="0" height="75" width="229" alt="Twitter" align="right" class="imgright" />That&#8217;s the question that everyone&#8217;s been asking and trying to answer for a year. What, exactly, is Twitter? Or, even better, why should you care?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been labeled as web-based chat, microblogging, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.smallbusinessbrief.com/articles/marketing/008115.html">mobile social software</a>&#8221;. John Gruber, web and technology pundit, said, &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/march#wed-21-kottke_twitter">Twitter is to IM and SMS what weblogs were to email and Usenet</a>&#8221;, while critics say it&#8217;s just another social networking website, or <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2007-04-05-twitter_N.htm">an added distraction</a> in an already over-distracted culture.</p>

<p>I think Twitter is more than all that &#8211; or at least the <em>idea</em> behind Twitter is.</p>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>Twitter, at the core, is a <strong>method of communication</strong>. It is, in fact, not a new method, but it&#8217;s a simple one. <span class="pullquote">What makes it special is the mobile support</span>, wherein a user can interact with Twitter via <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before I go further, let&#8217;s look at what protocols (or methods) Twitter uses. There are three main ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web</li>
<li>IM</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ol>

<p>All three protocols allow you to answer the question, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; and have it posted on your Twitter profile page (and, as I&#8217;ll show you, also forwarded onto those &#8220;following&#8221; you). To answer, simply text-message, IM or enter into web-form field whenever &#8211; or wherever &#8211; you want.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/twitter-statuses.jpg" border="0" height="98" width="200" alt="My Twitter status page" align="right" class="imgright" />Once you&#8217;ve sent your update (also known as &#8220;status&#8221; or &#8220;tweet&#8221; or a number of other terms relating), it appears on your Twitter profile page, and is automatically forwarded to other users who&#8217;ve chosen to follow you. This is where it gets a little tricky, though, because not everyone who choses to follow you will also chose to be notified. But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself &#8230;</p>

<h3>Followers</h3>

<p>There are two levels of Twitter profiles: <em>public</em> and <em>private</em>. A public profile is viewable online by everyone, but that user&#8217;s updates only get forwarded directly to users who follow them. A private profile is only viewable by those who&#8217;re set as friends by the owner of the profile. By default, a profile is set as public.</p>

<p>Following is inherently one-way &#8211; meaning if you choose to follow someone, you&#8217;ll receive their updates, but they won&#8217;t receive yours &#8230; that is, until they&#8217;ve reciprocally chosen to follow you.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you set your profile to private, you must approve followers. Once you do, the account relationship is automatically set both-ways and you&#8217;ll not only allow that follower to receive your updates, but you&#8217;ll also receive theirs.</p>

<p>If, say, you&#8217;ve chosen to follow a person but no longer wish to receive their updates on your phone or IM, you can set unique notification preferences to off. Their Twitter updates will still appear on your profile, and they will remain a followee (or friend) of yours.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note, now, that most (if not, all) handling of relationships and updates can be done via mobile phone using simple, natural commands. For example, if I wanted to turn off all notifications because I was in a meeting, I&#8217;d I&#8217;d simply text: <code>off</code>. Twitter will cease sending me any updates until I turn notifications back on.</p>

<p>To add a new followee, I simply text <code>follow [username]</code>. To invite a non-Twitter member: <code>invite [10-digit phone number]</code>. To turn off all notifications: <code>off</code>. Almost every function you&#8217;d need to be have mobile access to, you do.</p>

<p>You can even send a private message to a friend from a mobile phone, even if you don&#8217;t have their number. This came in handy for me while I was in Austin last month for SXSW. I was able to stay in constant communication with people I&#8217;d only met online and whose numbers I didn&#8217;t have, all through Twitter.</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>

<p>As I said, all this stuff isn&#8217;t really new. Twitter doesn&#8217;t bring <em>innovation</em> to the table so much as new <em>interaction</em> with innovation. What&#8217;s causing <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2007/03/15/tracking.shtml">Twitter&#8217;s astronomical growth</a> must have something to do with the uses people are coming up with for it. As a church staff member, I can think of at least a half-dozen off the top of my head!</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication with members</li>
<li>Communication with staff and pastors</li>
<li>Prayer alerts</li>
<li>Thought of the day from pastor</li>
<li>Mission trip communication (<a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=44">Twitter supports international numbers</a>, too!)</li>
<li>Multi-site service coordination (we&#8217;re already testing this possible use out)</li>
<li>Small group leader can keep in touch with members</li>
<li>Volunteer network can receive updates of schedule or procedure</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">John Edwards</a>, politician and presidential candidate, is on Twitter. <a href="http://twitter.com/foxnews">Fox News</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wsj">The Wall Streen Journal</a> tweet their headlines. <span class="pullquote">Heck, even <a href="http://twitter.com/santaclaus">Santa&#8217;s Twittering</a></span> now!</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation">Twitter&#8217;s <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a> has even made possible some cool third-party applications: <a href="http://twittervision.com/">Twittervision</a>, <a href="http://twitterholic.com/">Twitterholic</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a>, and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>, to name a few.</p>

<p>You get the point.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my opinion that anyone wanting to take advantage of web, mobile or new media technology needs to get on the Twitter bandwagon &#8211; if for no other reason, for research and ideas. Like I said, the <em>idea</em> behind Twitter is one that I think will drive a new wave of social interaction.</p>

<p>Besides that, though, it&#8217;s just plain fun.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/software_so_good">Software So Good ...</a></h2>
		<p>&#8230; it makes users bend over backwards to use it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsfire-icon.jpg" border="0" height="140" width="144" alt="NewsFire icon" align="right" class="imgright" />John Gruber today <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/april#mon-16-miller">published a link</a> to a <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/04/15/product_activation_sucks">blog post written by Charles Miller</a> about <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com">NewsFire</a> and its [abnormal] activation scheme. In case you&#8217;ve not been a reader of Geek &amp; Mild for at least a year, you might need to know that I&#8217;ve had a similar experience in dealing with David Watanabe, the creator of NewsFire. 
Here&#8217;s the issue: in order to activate NewsFire you must enter the email address you used to register the software. In my (and I assume Charles&#8217;) case, a commonly-known, public email address. The address is sent and checked with a server somewhere and verified.</p>

<p>This seems like an okay licensing solution since there&#8217;s no activation key to lose, no long serial string to save (and possibly lose) and no multi-level order number and registration code process. In fact, <span class="pullquote">activation is so easy it practically encourages the procedure</span>.</p>

<p>The problem, obviously, is security. What if, say, a valid email address is published on a blog whose author is an outspoken proponent of NewsFire and an obvious valid license-holder? You can bet they&#8217;ll be problems. (As hard as it is to imagine, there <em>are</em> dishonest people in this world.)</p>

<p>Do you think that&#8217;s the fault of the email address owner?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what David thinks. In the tension-filled email conversation that followed my blog post about this subject last year, David explained that I should have used a non-public email address and that his product activation scheme is as secure as its users make it. (He had a hard time even trusting that I was the genuine owner of the email address.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, we got it worked out. It was with great humility and pent-up emotions that I agreed to delete my blog post in exchange for the use of NewsFire using a different, more private email address. To this day, I have a bad taste in my mouth because of the way I was treated as a paid customer.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was just what Charles is doing &#8211; saying good riddance by admitting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David doesn&#8217;t want me as a customer, and given how few rights standard software licences actually grant the purchaser these days, I suspect he has the right to make that decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newsfire-interface.jpg" border="0" height="152" width="200" alt="NewsFire's interface" align="right" class="imgright" />I just couldn&#8217;t do that. You see, I&#8217;d tried out several alternative RSS readers (and continue to do so even now), none of which fit the bill &#8211; none like NewsFire. Whether it be a web-based solution, built-in to a browser, or a feature-laden desktop client, none compliment my lifestyle and computing habits like NewsFire.</p>

<p>In complete contrast to <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/developers_your_software_doesnt_work_unless_it_does_what_i_want/">my recent post about bad software ruining the experience</a>, NewsFire&#8217;s interface actually creates an experience wherein I willingly swallow my pride and practically beg to continue its use.</p>

		<p><img src="/assets/img/sncrz25n_z_20070414_20070414.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="200" alt="Sony IP Camera" align="right" class="imgright" />We&#8217;ve been demoing some new IP-based cameras for two our satellite campuses, Plateau and University. They&#8217;re <a href="http://bssc.sel.sony.com/BroadcastandBusiness/DisplayModel?id=78447">Sony SNC-RZ25N</a>&#8217;s, meant for security applications, but work quite well for what we&#8217;re intending them for: Low-fidelity interactivity with the pastor/speaker.</p>

<p>The image quality is good, considering the settings and environment they&#8217;re set in. They have an 18x optical zoom, as well as an additional 12x digital zoom. They have automatic and manual settings for everything from white balance, to aperture, to pan/tilt/zoom, to codec, to bitrate, etc. I&#8217;m really impressed with the features, and quality.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">What I&#8217;m <em>not</em> impressed with is the software</span>. The cameras are controlled (and viewed) using a web-based interface that relies heavily on proprietary technologies from Microsoft; specifically ActiveX.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the crux of it. The cameras have two codec modes: JPEG and MPEG. In MPEG mode the video quality is better when using less bandwidth, but requires a PC and Internet Explorer to view and/or control. The viewer and controller load inside an ActiveX object, which cannot be loaded into FireFox or a Mac-based browser apparently.</p>

<p>In order to even <em>view</em> the feed outside IE/PC I have to set the mode to JPEG, which uses more bandwidth, returns a lower frame-rate and quality, and uses Java (via a web-based applet) instead of ActiveX.</p>

<p>For this last Sunday (Easter Sunday) I managed to pull the viewer &#8211; only in JPEG mode &#8211; into a custom-built page by embedding the Java applet. The result was near the desired effect, as I was able to set a background color and give the feed a label so people could tell which campus it was. (I was also able to embed both feeds into the same page, side-by-side, letting the pastor see both feeds simultaneously.)</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t embed the DirectX version of the viewer, otherwise all would be good. But it doesn&#8217;t matter: The bottom line is that even though these cameras live up to (and even exceed certain) expectations, the software interface doesn&#8217;t let me do what I want. In my mind, that&#8217;s a deal-breaker.</p>

<p>Developers, your software doesn&#8217;t work unless it does what I want.</p>

<p>In this case, all I want is the ability to display the camera feed in an alternate context. Since it&#8217;s a web-based viewer, I should, hypothetically, be able to embed the feed in any web page &#8211; or, at the very least, be able to customize the interface for displaying in an appropriate context.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing to me that Sony shipped this camera in this state. <span class="pullquote">The software is so bad it renders the hardware almost unusable</span>. It&#8217;s obvious they didn&#8217;t consider such obvious applications as an embedded viewer &#8211; otherwise there&#8217;d at least be the ability, let alone documentation. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s neither, and I can&#8217;t help but think Sony wasn&#8217;t even concerned about the customers&#8217; needs.</p>

<p>So, again: Developers, it doesn&#8217;t matter how long it takes you to create, how great it is, or how many features it includes, your software doesn&#8217;t work unless it does what your user wants it to do.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/powering_an_audio_archive_with_expressionengine">02 April 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/powering_an_audio_archive_with_expressionengine">Powering an Audio Archive With ExpressionEngine</a></h2>
		<p>One of the most often-asked questions I receive is about how <a href="http://thecity.org/audio">The City Church&#8217;s audio archive</a> is powered. It&#8217;s easier than you&#8217;d expect, but does require a bit of explanation. So, as promised, here&#8217;s a look under the hood.</p>

<h3>Custom fields and weblog preferences</h3>

<p>ExpressionEngine&#8217;s weblogs, or &#8220;databases&#8221; as I&#8217;ve labeled them, are much more flexible than a typical two- or three-field weblog. They can have custom fields, and have dozens of settings. I&#8217;ve assigned our Audio Archive database a custom field group which, beyond &#8220;title&#8221; and &#8220;URL title&#8221;, has <em>an additional 13 fields</em>. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subtitle</code></li>
<li><code>speaker</code> (a drop-down menu, pre-populated with our pastors&#8217; names)</li>
<li><code>speaker_alt</code> (a text field for the speaker name if it&#8217;s not listed in the drop-down)</li>
<li><code>campus</code></li>
<li><code>servicetime</code> (a drop-down menu)</li>
<li><code>servicetime_alt</code> (in case of an alternate service time)</li>
<li><code>summary</code></li>
<li><code>fileid</code></li>
<li><code>graphic</code></li>
<li><code>notes</code></li>
<li><code>keywords</code></li>
<li><code>scriptures</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tccaa-fields.jpg" border="0" height="261" width="600" alt="Screenshot of the audio archive custom field group" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Each custom field comes with preference settings for type, formatting, hiding/showing, and instructions. Setting these preferences, I&#8217;m able to simplify the publish form as much as possible, but still give some advanced options to the publisher.</p>

<p>In addition to the custom fields, each entry (or &#8220;message&#8221; in this case) also has date, category, and status assignment(s). The nice thing about using a custom field for the service time is I don&#8217;t have to rely on our audio engineers (who do all the archive maintenance) to manually enter the service time in the entry date field &#8211; they simply click on the date itself. Also, since <span class="pullquote">entries can have multiple categories assigned to them</span>, a message can appear as a &#8220;Sunday Messages&#8221; and &#8220;Guest Speakers&#8221; entry simultaneously.</p>

<p>Speaking of categories, I&#8217;ve also set up a custom category group which has almost 30 categories (and sub-categories) for message assignment. They cover areas of ministry as well as special events. A few examples would be: &#8220;Sunday Messages&#8221;, &#8220;City Kids&#8221;, &#8220;Generation Church&#8221;, and &#8220;Men&#8217;s Ministry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Audio Archive database also has some unique preferences that set it apart as a non-textual-based weblog. For instance, I&#8217;ve set the default status to be &#8220;closed&#8221; so that an entry can be created without it being immediately published and live. This enables an audio engineer to create the entry during a service while the message is being preached, but not have it available until he/she confirms the details of, say, the title or summary.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also set the database to: 1) disallow trackbacks (and auto-discovery code) in entries; 2) notify me via email of each entry published; 3) not show formatting buttons, author menu or forum topic on the publish page.</p>

<h3>Setting up the templates</h3>

<p>The fun stuff is in the templates. That&#8217;s where the magic happens. When displayed on a webpage, each message entry has links to listen, download, buy, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tccaa-styledmessage_20070401.jpg" border="0" height="63" width="506" alt="Screenshot of a styled message entry" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a typical archive listing:</p>

<ol class="code">
    <li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;audioarchive&quot; limit=&quot;5&quot;&#125;</li>
    <li>&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;</li>

    <li>&lt;span&gt;&#123;if speaker != &quot;other&quot;&#125;&#123;speaker&#125;&#123;if:else&#125;&#123;speaker_alt&#125;&#123;/if&#125;&lt;/span&gt; &#123;entry_date format=&quot;%M %j, %Y&quot;&#125; &amp;bull; &#123;if servicetime != &quot;other&quot;&#125;&#123;servicetime&#125;&#123;if:else&#125;&#123;servicetime_alt&#125;&#123;/if&#125; &amp;bull; &#123;campus&#125;&lt;/p&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;ul&gt; </li>

<p>This code-block is found on the <a href="http://thecity.org/audio">index page</a> of the audio sub-section. Breaking it down, you can see I&#8217;ve wrapped each message in its own <code>div</code> with the class <code>message</code>. Inside the <code>div</code> I use a paragraph for <code>&#123;title&#125;</code> and some meta-info about the message. Notice the use of conditionals for <code>&#123;subtitle&#125;</code>, <code>speaker</code> and <code>servicetime</code>. If, for instance, the publisher gave the message a subtitle, it will appear in parenthesis after the title; if not, nothing will show.</p>

<p>Then (on line 5) comes the unordered list &#8211; with links to listen, download, buy, view notes or comment. The markup is pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the <strong>listen</strong> link a JavaScript is used to open a new window and call a single-entry template (<code>/message/&#123;entry_id&#125;</code>). The single-entry template is basically just a few <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> variables and an embedded MP3.</li>
<li>The <strong>download</strong> link utilizes <a href="http://elouai.com/force-download.php">a PHP script</a> that forces the users&#8217; browser to download the file (<code>&#123;fileid&#125;.mp3</code>) instead of load it.</li>
<li>The <strong>buy</strong> link is just a submit button inside a form with a bunch of ecommerce tags that pass the message data onto our third-party shopping cart app.</li>
<li>The <strong>notes</strong> link only appears if the &#123;notes&#125; field has a value.</li>
<li>The <strong>comments</strong> link uses a bunch of conditionals to either display the number of comments or &#8220;Add comment&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tccaa-unstyledmessage.jpg" border="0" height="61" width="200" alt="Screenshot of an unstyled message entry" class="imgright" />When unstyled, this code-block is relatively plain and [arguably] semantic. The only point of contention comes from the use of a transparent GIF for the form submit button. In hindsight I suppose I could&#8217;ve just used <code>input type="image"</code>, but I was preoccupied in trying to utilize CSS for all images.</p>

<p>Of course, ExpressionEngine has built-in support for XML templates, so serving a podcast is just as simple:</p>

<ol class="code">
    <li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;audioarchive&quot; category=&quot;4&quot; orderby=&quot;date&quot; sticky=&quot;off&quot; limit=&quot;10&quot;  rdf=&quot;off&quot;&#125;</li>

    <li>&lt;link&gt;&#123;url_title_path=message&#125;&lt;/link&gt;</li>

    <li>&lt;itunes:author&gt;&#123;if speaker_alt !=&apos;&apos;&#125;&#123;speaker_alt&#125;&#123;/if&#125;&#123;if speaker_alt ==&apos;&apos;&#125;&#123;speaker&#125;&#123;/if&#125;&lt;/itunes:author&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;itunes:subtitle&gt;&#123;if summary&#125;&#123;summary&#125;&#123;if:else&#125;Speaker: &#123;if speaker_alt&#125;&#123;speaker_alt&#125;&#123;if:else&#125;&#123;speaker&#125;&#123;/if&#125; - This message was preached on &#123;entry_date format=&quot;%F %j%S&quot;&#125; at the &#123;servicetime&#125; service, at the &#123;campus&#125; Campus.

No additional summary available.&#123;/if&#125;&lt;/itunes:summary&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;!&#8211; end itunes-specific tags &#8211;&gt;</li>
    <li>&#123;exp:feed_enclosures&#125;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecity.org/audioarchive/&#123;fileid&#125;.mp3&quot; rel=&quot;enclosure&quot;&gt;&#123;title&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&#123;/exp:feed_enclosures&#125;</li>
    <li>&lt;/item&gt;</li>
    <li>&#123;/exp:weblog:entries&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>&#8230; Okay, so it doesn&#8217;t look so simple &#8211; but with proper code formatting and highlighting it becomes much easier to understand. I won&#8217;t go into detail about every line, but I will point out a few key elements.</p>

<p>First, notice the use of <code>&lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;</code> for the <code>&#123;summary&#125;</code> field. I use it because the field is set with no formatting, allowing me to format on the template-side &#8211; in this case, using the Markdown plugin.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can see I&#8217;m using a lot of iTunes-specific code. I suppose it goes without saying, but a podcast without these tags will have an uphill battle getting exposure on the iTunes Podcast Directory.</p>

<p>Finally, notice the actual file link is wrapped in <code>&#123;exp:feed_enclosures&#125;</code>. This tag performs some wizardry and somehow quantifies the file&#8217;s bit-size and serves a correctly formatted <code>enclosure</code> element. At least, I think that&#8217;s what it does.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the archives</h3>

<p>So with this infrastructure in place, <span class="pullquote">maintenance of the audio archive has been effortless for me</span>. The only thing I need to do is quality control; making sure message details are correct, no weird symbols are used, and the website stays online. I&#8217;m completely out of the loop during the process, which (I&#8217;ve been told) goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The message is recorded to a master CD during the service</li>
<li>The master CD is then ripped and (quickly) edited for content and equalization</li>
<li>The audio file is compressed and encoded as an MP3 (64k kbps, 22.050kHz, mono)</li>
<li>The file is uploaded to the server</li>
<li>A new entry is created in the audio archive <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> database</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m yawning just thinking about how little I have to do to keep it all going. ExpressionEngine rocks.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/adobe_announces_creative_suite_3">27 March 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/adobe_announces_creative_suite_3">Adobe Announces Creative Suite 3</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/cs3-productgrid_20070327.jpg" border="0" height="233" width="300" alt="Adobe's CS3 Product Grid" class="imgright" />Today <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/">Adobe announced Creative Suite 3</a>. The accompanying product matrix makes even Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Vista version grid look simple. It&#8217;s a mess to sort out, even for a veteran Adobe user.</p>

<p>Visiting the product page I thought to myself, &#8220;it would be nice if they offered some sort of &#8216;select the products you use/need and we&#8217;ll show you which package to buy&#8217; feature.&#8221; Further exploration revealed a handy <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/?cs3Tabs=cs3products">Product Selector applet</a> (Flash, of course) that seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, as soon as it was done pre-loading I realized it fell short; offering <em>areas</em> of design, rather than specific products for use.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cs3-questionnaire.jpg" border="0" height="293" width="557" alt="Adobe's CS3 Product Finder applet" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I think, Adobe, it&#8217;s safe to assume the majority of your consumers know which products they need already.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I attempted to fill out the &#8220;questionnaire&#8221; anyway &#8211; curious what product package would be recommended for my somewhat unique requirements. Here&#8217;s what I checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Graphic design&#8221; &#8211; since I design graphics</li>
<li>&#8220;Print publishing&#8221; &#8211; since sometimes I design graphics for print</li>
<li>&#8220;Illustration&#8221; &#8211; since this probably collates to Illustrator, and I need that for certain projects (including logo design, grey-box layouts, etc.)</li>
<li>&#8220;Web/interactive design&#8221; &#8211; since that&#8217;s what I do</li>
<li>Not &#8220;Web development&#8221; &#8211; since I don&#8217;t need an Adobe product to write code</li>
<li>&#8220;User interface design&#8221; &#8211; since that, too, is what I do</li>
<li>&#8220;Mobile development&#8221; &#8211; since Mobile is the new New</li>
<li>&#8220;Photography&#8221; &#8211; since I take photos</li>
<li>&#8220;Image editing and compositing&#8221; &#8211; since that&#8217;s what, uh, Photoshop is for</li>
<li>&#8220;Motion graphics / visual effects&#8221; &#8211; since on occasion I create motion graphic menus and intros for various video projects</li>
<li>&#8220;Interactive / multimedia&#8221; &#8211; since, as I said, sometimes I delve into video graphics</li>
</ul>

<p>What was suggested? Of course! The mamma-jamma Master Collection, retailing for $2,500, with an upgrade cost for me (with my CS2 Standard license) of $1,999.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at what I&#8217;d get with the Master Collection &#8230; no, better yet, let&#8217;s look at what I <em>don&#8217;t need, but would still get</em> with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe InDesign CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional</li>
<li>Adobe Dreamweaver CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Fireworks CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Contribute CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Premier Pro CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Soundbooth CS3</li>
<li>Adobe Encore CS3</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230; not to mention the various &#8220;shared features&#8221; I don&#8217;t use or need, such as Version Cue, Device Central, Acrobat Connect, Dynamic Link, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll just upgrade Photoshop.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/removing_www_from_a_domain">Removing &#8220;www&#8221; From a Domain</a></h2>
		<p>Here&#8217;s what I do to remove &#8220;www&#8221; from my domain. I put this code in my .htaccess file:</p>

<ol class="code">
 <li>RewriteEngine On</li>
 <li>#Handle removal of &#8220;www&#8221;</li>
 <li>RewriteCond %&#123;HTTP_HOST&#125; ^www.YOURDOMAIN.com(.*)$ [NC]</li>
 <li>RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://YOURDOMAIN.com/$1 [R=301,L]</li>
</ol>

<p>A couple quick notes about this method if you want to use it as your own:</p>

<ol>
<li>In order to see/edit .htaccess, you may have to show &#8220;invisible&#8221; files in your FTP application.</li>
<li>This only works on servers running Apache.</li>
</ol>

		<time><a href="/entry/southbye">14 March 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/southbye">Southbye</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/sxsw-logo2007.gif" border="0" height="159" width="180" alt="SXSW logo" class="imgright" />On Sunday night I flew into Austin, the site of SXSW, an annual film, music and interactive design festival. It was my first time attending, so I was apprehensive about it. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to go it alone &#8211; the Great Canadian, <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain</a>, and I were Southby Rookies together.</p>

<h3>The laptop culture</h3>

<p>Though it wasn&#8217;t the first thing I noticed, certainly one of the most prevalent visuals at the conference was the polarized groups of laptop users. Here were my observations of the laptop culture:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were more PC users than I expected &#8211; probably as much as 20%.</li>
<li>Two types of users: Those that put stickers on their laptops, and those that don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>If SXSW attendees are any indication, the transition to Intel-based Macs has definitely worked for Apple; everyone had a MacBook or MacBook Pro.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no place a laptop cannot be used (including the restroom).</li>
</ol>

<p>I know Austin <del>is</del> <ins>claims to be</ins> the live music capital of the world, but for me it felt more like the laptop capital. Honestly, I have never so many laptops being used in one place.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next observation: <span class="pullquote">The WiFi sucked</span> (for me). I don&#8217;t know if it was the amount of network activity, or my AirPort antenna, or what; but it seemed like most everyone had a good connection but me. I was able to get better speeds by using my BlackBerry as a bluetooth modem! Even at my hotel access was decent at best. Overall, I was disappointed in Austin&#8217;s internets.</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> was everywhere. One panel attendee commented (over the mic) that <span class="pullquote alt">Twitter was like crack</span> &#8211; her question was to Tim Ferriss (author of <a href="http://www.timferriss.com/book.php">The 4-Hour Work Week</a>), about how to &#8220;get off the crack.&#8221; Before panels began, moderators would ask that attendees switch their mobile phones to silent, turn off their laptop sound, and &#8220;keep the Tweets to a minimum.&#8221; Plasma screens, showing a <a href="http://sxsw.twitter.com/">fun presentation</a> of Twitters, donned most of the hallways.</p>

<p>You can imagine: In a world dominated by geeks, coders and artists, the mobile phone usage was at a maximum &#8230; the weird thing was, no one held their mobiles to their ear. Everyone was hunched over, frantically thumb-tapping and, I can only assume, answering the question, &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/">what are you doing?</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I hopped on the bandwagon a week prior to SXSW and learned how to take advantage of the mobile functionality. I blended right in. Jesse, on the other hand&#8211;</p>

<h3>Godbit meetup</h3>

<p>Monday night I was fortunate to meet up with a bunch of fellow members of <a href="http://www.godbit.com">Godbit</a>. It was great to put faces to names (and screen names). They were all very gracious, and although I didn&#8217;t get to personally meet everyone, the conversations I had with the few seated around me were worth the trip. I finally got to meet <a href="http://www.couchfort.net">Rob Soule</a>, and really enjoyed chatting (and playing Wii) with <a href="http://www.sporadicnonsense.com/">Shawn Grimes</a> and <a href="http://www.davidhemphill.com/">David Hemphill</a>.</p>

<p>A big thanks to <a href="http://www.artofmission.com">Ryan Heneise</a> for organizing it, and, of course, to <a href="http://www.sonspring.com">Nathan Smith</a>, the founder of Godbit.</p>

<h3>Panels</h3>

<p>Sessions at SXSW are broken up into smaller panels &#8211; each consisting of 1&ndash;5 panelists, with formats ranging from arranged presentation to open discussion. They were, I admit, hit and miss.</p>

<p>Of the panels I attended, only three really kept and held my attention, and of those, only two challenged or taught me. I don&#8217;t have attention deficit disorder, but I&#8217;m certainly spoiled, coming from a church environment where I hear dynamic preachers every week. I understand panelists are chosen for their knowledge and experience, not their ability to speak publicly, so I won&#8217;t consider complaining about the lack of presentational passion. The fact is, though, <span class="pullquote">the majority of panel content lacked for substance</span>, too.</p>

<p>I guess it&#8217;s true what they say: SXSW is about <em>networking</em>.</p>

<h3>Meeting the greats</h3>

<p>If there&#8217;s any reason to attend SXSW, it&#8217;s to rub shoulders with the cream-of-the-crop of web design and development. Among them was <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>, <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://www.simplebits.com">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>, <a href="http://www.robweychert.com/">Rob Weychert</a>, <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a>, <a href="http://www.dkeithrobinson.com/">D. Keith Robinson</a>, <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com">Greg Storey</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca/jonathan/">Jonathan Snook</a>, <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.jeffcroft.com">Jeff Croft</a>, <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com">Steve Smith</a>, <a href="http://boxofchocolates.ca/">Derek Featherstone</a> &#8230; oh my word, the list just goes on! Even <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon Hicks</a> (in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/flathicks/">some form</a>, at least) was present!</p>

<p>While I didn&#8217;t get to actually meet everyone on that list, seeing and hearing them (if they spoke in a panel) was awesome. I ran into <a href="http://www.virb.com/simmy">Ryan Sims</a> in the main hall, practically cornered him, and introduced myself (and Jesse). <span class="pullquote alt">It was as if I ran into Bono</span>. I was giddy and absolutely unaware of what I said.</p>

<p>That was Monday morning &#8211; thereafter I stopped no other web-celeb.</p>

<p>I did, though, enjoy meeting all-stars <a href="http://bw.watchtan.com/">Brian Warren</a> and <a href="http://www.markbixby.com">Mark Bixby</a> of Methodarts, and Scott Boms (<a href="http://www.wishingline.com">Wishingline</a>). Jesse and I sat directly behind them in John Gruber and Shaun Inman&#8217;s session (oh, yeah, did I mention <em>those</em> guys in the list?!) and went to lunch with them afterwards. I&#8217;ve always had great respect for Mark as a designer, and last year was bummed I couldn&#8217;t take him up on <a href="http://www.markbixby.com/blog/entry/free-starbucksreg-at-sxsw/">his offer for a free coffee</a>. It was Brian who provided the free coffee this year, and I&#8217;m really glad I didn&#8217;t miss out. They&#8217;re great guys and they even let me snap a few shots on their Nikon D80&#8217;s.</p>

<p>(Have I mentioned I&#8217;m in the market for a digital SLR?)</p>

<h3>Next time</h3>

<p>Maybe it was the sensory overload; or the stinky Austin water; or perhaps Twitter itself; but whatever the reason, I was a complete photo-taking failure on this trip! That&#8217;s unusual for me, since I&#8217;m typically the annoying one, snapping pictures mid-conversation. Next year I promise to do better.</p>

<p>Next year I&#8217;ll also try and get there on time and perhaps stay an extra day. I desperately missed my wife, though, so I&#8217;ll be sure to bring her, too.</p>

<p>Next year I&#8217;ll bring business cards. I had opted out of doing so this year because I&#8217;m really not available for hire. I missed the point, though. No one wants to hire me &#8211; they just want my contact info so they can follow my Twitter feed. Or something like that.</p>

<p>And next year I&#8217;ll be sure to bring an umbrella.</p>

		<time><a href="/entry/the_remaking_of_version_3">10 March 2007</a></time>
		<h2><a href="/entry/the_remaking_of_version_3">The Remaking of Version 3</a></h2>
		<p>It takes a certain amount of obsessive compulsion, I think, to be good at what you do. This thing called the internets is what I do &#8211; and believe you me, I&#8217;m obsessed. Not more than a day after I launched Version 3 of this site I began revamping the way the site displays blog entries.</p>

<p>Now, instead of using the direct query method I <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/the_making_of_version_3">showed previously</a>, I use an entirely separate blog for links. Not only does this simplify my homepage code and reduce the amount of database queries, it also allows me to more easily manage the entries; where and how they&#8217;re displayed.</p>

<p>This is made possible by <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr>&#8217;s support for multiple weblogs inside one <code>exp:weblog:entries</code> tag. So this:</p>

<ol class="code">
 <li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;blog&quot; limit=&quot;20&quot; paginate=&quot;bottom&quot;&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>Becomes this:</p>

<ol class="code">
 <li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;blog|quickblog&quot; limit=&quot;20&quot; paginate=&quot;bottom&quot;&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>Another benefit of using this method is that I can now use the auxiliary &#8220;quickblog&#8221; for more than just links. Every category is now available to me &#8211; so if I have a quick thought about, say, design, I can just post it in the design category and not worry that it&#8217;s being displayed as a major article.</p>

<p>Additionally, the separation of quick-natured blog posts from those that require more attention (and time to read) creates an opportunity for isolating them in aggregation, for example, in an RSS feed.</p>

<p>For those wondering, yes, this is very much like a tumblelog. In fact, I&#8217;m experimenting with Andrew Weaver&#8217;s sweet, new FeedGrab plugin in order to pull in my Ma.gnolia links, Twitter statuses, Flickr photos, and Newsvine seeds. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>

<h3>Howsit done?</h3>

<p>So here&#8217;s my new homepage code:</p>

<ol class="code">
 <li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;seanblog|quickblog&quot; limit=&quot;20&quot; paginate=&quot;bottom&quot;&#125;</li>
 <li>&#123;if weblog_id != &quot;8&quot;&#125;</li>
 <li>&lt;div class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;</li>
 <li>&#123;exp:markypants&#125;&#123;summary&#125;&#123;/exp:markypants&#125;</li>
 <li>&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#123;url_title_path=entry&#125;&quot;&gt;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;</li>
 <li>&#123;if:else&#125;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;</li>
 <li>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#123;entry_date format=&quot;%M %j%S&quot;&#125; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#123;url_title_path=entry&#125;&quot;&gt;&#123;title&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</li>

<p>You can see I&#8217;m able to pull entries from two different weblogs using the same <code>&#123;exp:weblog:entries&#125;</code> tag. I just separate each using the pipe character. Then I use the <code>weblog_id</code> for the conditional and display entries uniquely based on which blog they came from, regardless of category. Again, this allows me to quickly post a thought, image, quote or link in the &#8220;quickblog&#8221; without it being displayed as a full-fledged post.</p>

<p>Questions, comments, concerns?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be on a plane to <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">Austin</a> right now. As luck would have it, the church&#8217;s video switcher wasn&#8217;t working this morning as I attempted to give a run-down of operations to my stand-in for Sunday services. Quick and unsuccessful attempts to troubleshoot the problem led to a last-minute decision: I&#8217;m going to fly out after services, on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been anticipating going to &#8220;<a href="http://www.sxswblog.com/">Southby</a>&#8221; for months. It&#8217;s a bummer that I can&#8217;t make the entire thing, but I completely understand the decision and need for me to stay. Actually, I feel better. I was beginning to feel anxious about leaving my (weekend) duties to someone else. Even though they&#8217;re capable, the system they must run is not &#8211; another story entirely.</p>

<p>So, for those I was expecting to meet up with at SXSW &#8211; namely <a href="http://www.31three.com">Jesse</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry. The Wii playing and shop-talk will have to wait until Sunday.</p>
