    <p>In case you&#8217;ve been curious, here&#8217;s a few projects I&#8217;ve been busy with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/library">/library</a> &#8211; A promo page dedicated to our new Library.</li>
<li>Implemented jQuery and converted the carousel thingy on our <a href="http://thecity.org">homepage</a> to use jCarousel.</li>
<li>Whipped up a <a href="https://www.thecity.org/groups/new">quick-fix</a> for a <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/90558/">processing error we had</a> with our Groups registration form.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thecity.org">blog.thecity.org</a> &#8211; Moved and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">re-aligned</a> Pastor Wendell&#8217;s blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/big/">/big</a> &#8211; A promo page for the next two weeks and beginning of the Anniversary year.</li>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/pwp">/pwp</a> &#8211; A promo page for our upcoming conference.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is, of course, a common thread throughout all of those projects: <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>, <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Without them there&#8217;s no way I would have been able to accomplish that list &#8211; in the 8 days I took.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/lines">Lines</a></h2>
    <p>So I just got back from the local Apple Store (empty-handed thanks to their policy about requiring the primary account holder to be present, yadda yadda &#8211; don&#8217;t get me started), and I thought I&#8217;d post this bit of interesting info about people lining up for the iPhone 3G.</p>

<p>It seems that the lines (which, by the way, are <em>still</em> insanely long &#8211; I mean, does anyone else not see how absolutely crazy this is?) are less because of the overall demand and more because of the slow exercise of activating the device. An employee even told me they only had only two personnel assigned to the job of activations, and admitted that&#8217;s the reason for the long waits.</p>

<p>So are they spiting AT&amp;T, or their customers, with that strategy? Two employees? Really, Apple? Do you realize what people are doing for these iPhone thingies?</p>

    <p>Got this in my inbox tonight:</p>

  <p>Dear Sean,</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for giving up soda and sugar substitutes, that&#8217;s been a huge blessing. Now to business.</p>
  
  <p>I know you&#8217;ve been heavily weighing the option of getting an iPhone 3G on Friday, and have already looked at all the pros and cons. I also know you saved the money from the sale of the &#8211; what was it again? Oh, yeah, the PowerBook &#8211; to purchase it. (Wow, I haven&#8217;t said that name in years. I had to have my Knowledge Navigator look it up for me.)</p>
  
  <p>Well, let me just tell you: Don&#8217;t do it. Skip it. Keep your current iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>You see, here in the future, the only companies that have survived are the ones that look after their customers. While some companies expanded their energy and resources trying to contain handfuls of pirates and scammers, others concentrated on improving their loyal customers&#8217; user experience. Unfortunately, AT&amp;T is not one of the latter type. In classic Galactic Empire fashion, they tightened their grip, and the pirates slipped through their fingers. It drove their cellular division to the ground.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile Apple has been pounding out product after product after product &#8211; with services, too! You should see their new home gardening appliance. Freakin&#8217; awesome. Comes out in time for the Holiday season. But why am I telling you? You don&#8217;t even care about gardening yet.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, I just wanted to give you fair warning. You don&#8217;t want to be locked into AT&amp;T any longer than you have to. They had a good run, but once Apple decided to give them the boot and launch their own communications service platform, it was over. (Truth be told, though, I knew way before then &#8211; when AT&amp;T started courting other manufacturers trying to come up with an iPhone killer. It happens sooner than you think.)</p>
  
  <p>Also, hey, don&#8217;t worry about that rash. It goes away.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,<br />
  Future Sean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what do you think? I say Future Sean&#8217;s an idiot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting an iPhone 3G this Friday.</p>

    <p>While watching the &#8220;QuickTour&#8221; of Me.com I noticed something on the Account page that piqued my curiosity: A setting for &#8220;Personal Domain&#8221;.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/mobileme-account.jpg" alt="MobileMe Account page" border="0" width="459" height="349" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen this documented elsewhere, so I did a little digging. As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s just a transferred <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Dotmac/Member/en/gen367.html">feature</a> from .Mac; which I didn&#8217;t know existed. According to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1932">this transition FAQ</a>, personal domains already in use with .Mac will carry over and also work with MobileMe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] If you have a personal domain setup for your iWeb site, it will continue to work without changing any settings at your registrar.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/how_i_rate_my_music">How I Rate My Music</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/itunes-playlists.jpg" alt="Screenshot of iTunes Playlists" border="0" width="175" height="177" class="imgright" />A proper (read as &#8220;useful&#8221;) method for rating my music &#8211; with stars, in iTunes &#8211; has eluded me ever since the feature was introduced. Here&#8217;s a new method I&#8217;m trying; which I couldn&#8217;t fit into a 140-character Tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 stars = &#8220;I could listen to this song anytime, in any mood&#8221;</li>
<li>4 stars = &#8220;I love it&#8221;</li>
<li>3 stars = &#8220;I like it&#8221;</li>
<li>2 stars = &#8220;It&#8217;s okay (but I have to be in the mood)&#8221;</li>
<li>1 stars = &#8220;Not a fan &#8230; but I keep it around for some reason&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to rate every song in my library with this system. Unrated songs will be left unchecked, and won&#8217;t play in shuffle mode or get transferred to my iPhone. I&#8217;m starting by rating entire albums, or at least those I can, confidentially.</p>

<p>Coupled with data iTunes records automatically (e.g. play count, times skipped, etc.), ratings can prove very helpful in fulfilling preference. For instance, finding songs that I love but haven&#8217;t played in a while could be as easy as creating a Smart Playlist that matches checked songs that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a rating of greater than 3 stars</li>
<li>Kind doesn&#8217;t contain &#8220;video&#8221;</li>
<li>Last Played is not in the last 3 months (a &#8220;played&#8221; song must play through entirely, I believe)</li>
<li>Last Skipped is not in the last 3 months (for a song to be &#8220;skipped&#8221; it must have played at least 1 second first)</li>
<li>Skip Count is less than 3</li>
<li>Date Added is not in the last 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>That Playlist returned just under 400 great songs I&#8217;d either forgotten about, or haven&#8217;t listened to in months! I&#8217;m rediscovering my music.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/waiting_on_the_macbook_pro">Waiting on the MacBook Pro</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/mbp2008-mockup.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro mockup by 'bayol05' of MacRumors forums" border="0" width="250" height="158" class="imgright" />It was with disbelief and frustration that I read this statement in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/02/03/new-macbook-pros-appearing-in-retail-inventory/">an article</a> published on MacRumors ten days ago (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the new MacBook Pros will likely incorporate only modest updates (Penryn and Multi-Touch), with their imminent release, <em>its hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d just hit &#8220;Submit&#8221; on an order for a MacBook Pro just 15 minutes earlier &#8211; after a furious internal debate over waiting or not. I knew revisions for the pro-line machines were coming, but with my current PowerBook G4 (early-2005) acting more like a boat anchor than a productivity tool, and with a demanding work schedule and task-list, I felt I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.</p>

<p>That statement shook me, though. <em>It&#8217;s hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>. It echoed in my head and haunted me for the rest of the evening &#8211; until I decided it was true. It <em>was</em> hard to justify it. In fact, it was too hard, so I cancelled my order.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m waiting, credit card in hand, for &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know. Based on the rumors, it sounds like the new MacBook Pros will have new, Penryn processors, feature the new multi-touch trackpad (as found on the MacBook Air), and possibly have a new enclosure and/or a black keyboard.</p>

<p>To me, none of those items are worth waiting for. Since I&#8217;m upgrading from a PPC G4, I&#8217;m apathetic to a processor update &#8211; I&#8217;d be happy with a 2GHz Core Duo right now. I couldn&#8217;t care less about the multi-touch trackpad. And a new enclosure is actually potentially bad for me, as I&#8217;ve happily touted a 15-inch, aluminum laptop around for years.</p>

<p>So, really, I guess I&#8217;m waiting for two reasons: (1) so I don&#8217;t buy a brand new laptop that is practically obsolete the day it&#8217;s delivered, and (2) in case Apple introduces a next-generation MacBook Pro instead of just a revision to the current one.</p>

<p>At least I don&#8217;t feel alone in my particular campaign. <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4861601#post4861601">Hundreds</a> (if not, thousands) of others are also waiting on the new MacBook Pros. Based on what I&#8217;ve read, these are serious buyers, not just fanboys who can&#8217;t wait to see what Apple has up their sleeve. With the MacBook Air missing a niche market of professional users, you can almost smell the money people are ready to throw at Apple for a new, full-featured laptop.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/website_launch_generation_church_conference_2008">Website Launch: Generation Church Conference 2008</a></h2>
    <p>Last night I hit the &#8220;Launch&#8221; button on the [second revision] of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://generationchurch.org/conference/2008">Generation Church Conference mini-site</a>. I really had fun with this one. The design is grid-based, the typeface is Helvetica (Extended), and the navigation is dynamic. 
This project marks the first time I&#8217;ve publicly utilized the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS framework</a> &#8211; which I&#8217;m absolutely loving. Not only did it save me time in development, but it also really helped me keep focus during the design stage. The default 24-column grid provided a construct from which I was able to be creative, but still controlled.</p>

<p>This is also the first time I&#8217;ve launched a website without first testing in Internet Explorer 6. It feels good. It feels <em>real</em> good.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/an_introduction_to_expression_engine">An Introduction to ExpressionEngine</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/ee-logo.jpg" alt="ee-logo.jpg" border="0" width="272" height="70" class="imgright" />People may refer to ExpressionEngine as a blogging application, and it&#8217;s true that the design evolved from one; but it&#8217;s much more. Underneath the hood (get it?), <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> has the power to drive even most large-scale websites. If you&#8217;re looking for a reason to invest some time and effort into learning and installing it, keep reading. This article is intended for those who might already have a website, but who want to upgrade to using a content management system, or for those who might be disillusioned by their current <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>. 
Before continuing, you should know that I&#8217;m assuming: (1) that you know what a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> is, (2) that you have a basic understanding of the technologies that power a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>, and (3) that you have already explored, or at least browsed, the <a href="http://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine website</a> and have a general idea of what it does. I don&#8217;t want you to get hung up on terminology or technical concepts and disregard ExpressionEngine as too complicated. One of the reasons for choosing <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> over another content management system is because it&#8217;s easy to learn, deploy and use.</p>

<h3>The weblog module</h3>

<p>ExpressionEngine is modular, and is built for scaling. However, there is one primary module that could be considered the heart of the app: the &#8220;weblog&#8221; module. This module is where most content is stored and is extremely flexible. Case in point is the ability to change the name of the module itself &#8211; or, at least, the ability to put an alternate label on it. In fact, for the sake of clarity, and to underscore the dynamic range the module has, I&#8217;ll start referring to &#8220;weblogs&#8221; as &#8220;channels&#8221;.</p>

<p>Channels can be anything. They can be product catalogs, media archives, calendars, graphic libraries, et al. Think of a channel as a container of items, and the items as basically anything you want. ExpressionEngine allows for multiple (limitless, even) channels.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is by using <a href="http://thecity.org">The City Church website</a> as an example. On our site we have multiple channels, all simultaneously available, and all accessed using the same (&#8220;weblog&#8221;) module. One obvious channel is our audio archive, where each message/sermon is an entry. Other channels contain our homepage content, small groups catalog, and online bookstore. Each channel is unique in both form and function, and, as I said, each is powered by the same module.</p>

<h3>Field, category and status groups</h3>

<p>If channels are the heart of <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr>, then groups are its arteries. Each channel has three group assignments as part of its setup: a custom field group, a category group, and a status group. These groups are separated from the channel so they may be actively accessible to other channels. This allows channels to share, say, the same categories, but still have different custom fields.</p>

<p>Custom field groups are comprised of &#8230; yep, custom fields. The default set of fields (Title, URL Title, Summary, and Body) are typical to a blog, but if your channel is meant to be something besides a blog, you can create new custom fields for it. For instance, for The City Church&#8217;s audio archive channel, I&#8217;ve created a custom fields that apply to a message and its audio file, such as &#8220;Speaker&#8221;, &#8220;Campus&#8221;, &#8220;Service Time&#8221;, &#8220;File ID&#8221; etc. (<a href="/entry/powering_an_audio_archive_with_expressionengine">Read more on how the audio archive is powered</a>.)</p>

<p>Category and status groups are basically the same. Statuses, though, play an important role as they have the ability to control an entry&#8217;s ranking or position.</p>

<p>More on groups can be found in the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs">exhaustive ExpressionEngine documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>

<p>You can think of templates in ExpressionEngine just like web pages. In their simplest form, that&#8217;s all they are. Keeping the same analogous theme, templates could be considered the skin of an EE-powered website &#8230; beautiful, external, and flexible; yes, that works.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">ExpressionEngine&#8217;s templates are what makes it so unique</span>, but they&#8217;re also where most newcomers to <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> get stuck. I think the flexibility they offer is, ironically, where the confusion comes in. Templates in <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> lack the rigidity found in other <abbr title="content management systems">CMS</abbr>s. Instead of having a clear and obvious framework, <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr>&#8217;s templates allow you to think outside the box when architecting. The concepts are strange at first, however, the system is forgiving enough that when you finally get a handle on how it all works you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever did dynamic websites before.</p>

<p>The first thing to understand with <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> templates is that they&#8217;re stored in the main, MySQL database, and are not actual files. (There is a caveat to this, though, because <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> does let users save templates to the server as files.) Actually, when visitors browse an <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr>-powered website, they&#8217;re only ever accessing one file: index.php. That one file is able to reference the whole of the system, including templates, modules, and plugins.</p>

<p>Templates are grouped into &#8220;template groups&#8221;. Template groups are more than just organizational, and can be extremely versatile in function &#8211; more on that later. First, let&#8217;s look at the ExpressionEngine URL structure, and how template groups and templates come into play:</p>

<p><code>http://www.example.com/index.php/template_group/template</code></p>

<p>After the domain is the index.php file I mentioned. Again, that one file is the key to engaging the EE system. Once <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> is invoked, it takes the URL request, and breaks it down; first looking for a template group, then an individual template. This URL structure is &#8220;human-friendly&#8221; (versus, say, www.domain.com/index.php?page=1&amp;id=2), and also <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs/general/urls.html">search engine optimized</a>.</p>

<p>The tendency is to think of templates and template groups as files and directories &#8211; and that&#8217;s just what the EE documentation suggests &#8211; but that might lead to more frustration than anything else. I prefer to think of template groups as &#8220;topics&#8221; or &#8220;themes&#8221;, and templates as &#8220;functions&#8221;. I think of them this way because templates can be embedded into other templates, and template groups represent more than just groupings of templates.</p>

<p>When building a site in <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr>, you can use individual templates for each screen your visitors will see, or, if you&#8217;re clever, you could build one template &#8211; a Lord of the Rings type thing; one template to rule them all. How, you ask? Through the power of URL segments.</p>

<h3>URL segments, global variables, and other such trickery</h3>

<p>I mentioned that one of the primary reasons to choose ExpressionEngine is because it&#8217;s easy to learn, deploy and use; and that&#8217;s true. But <span class="pullquote">the main reason I use it is because of its power and flexibility</span> &#8211; most of which is found in features exclusive to EE.</p>

<p>The first such feature is URL segments. As I&#8217;ve <a href="/entry/expression_engine_and_the_power_of_url_segments">illustrated previously on my blog</a>, URL segments can be extremely useful when coupled with templates. Since ExpressionEngine is essentially taking over the job of serving a website (from the server itself), it also actively processes URL requests, no matter how long, and breaks them down into what are called segments. So in our example above, EE would see the URL and assign <code>&#123;segment_1&#125;</code> as &#8220;template_group&#8221; and <code>&#123;segment_2&#125;</code> as &#8220;template&#8221;. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine how beneficial having that kind of association can be. I&#8217;ll give you an example.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve been asked to make some changes to the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of a website. No, problem, right? Just pull up the &#8220;about&#8221; template, make the changes, and hit &#8220;Finished&#8221;. But what if, before the changes are published, you have to get them approved? You could create a new template, call it &#8220;about-preview&#8221;, and copy/paste the &#8220;about&#8221; template in, make the changes, and send the new URL to your client for approval. Or, by using URL segments, you can make it much easier and transparent. You&#8217;d just open the &#8220;about&#8221; template, wrap the changes in a conditional statement &#8211; <code>&#123;if segment_3 == "preview"&#125;</code> &#8211; and tell your client to add &#8220;/preview&#8221; to the end of the URL.</p>

<p>We can even take this example further, and apply some other cool ExpressionEngine features like global variables, member groups, and plugins.</p>

<p>To protect the changes from prying eyes, you could also require your client be logged in before viewing the changes. You&#8217;d do this by changing the conditional statement to <code>&#123;if logged_in AND segment_3 == "preview"&#125;</code>. Or you might want to make sure only they can see it, not another logged in member: <code>&#123;if username == "client_name" AND segment_3 == "preview"&#125;</code>. Even better, let&#8217;s make an idiot-proof link they can click to see the changes:</p>

<p><code>&#123;if username == "client_name" AND segment_3 == ""&#125;&lt;a href="&#123;path=template_group/about/preview&#125;"&gt;Click here to see changes&lt;/a&gt;&#123;/if&#125;</code></p>

<p>To show your client that they are, in fact, viewing the latest revision of changes, you could include a time-stamp, showing the time the &#8220;about&#8221; template was last edited: <code>(Edited: &#123;template_edit_date format="%%F %d, %Y at %h:%i %A"&#125;)</code>, which would render as &#8220;(Edited: January 26, 2008 at 4:53 PM)&#8221;. You could even include the time since they last visited by employing a third-party plugin called &#8220;Since Last Visit&#8221;.</p>

<p>Can you see how powerful (and even fun) ExpressionEngine can be?</p>

<h3>Flexibility at a premium</h3>

<p>What makes ExpressionEngine so flexible could also be considered its greatest weakness. That you have to edit and save templates inside a web browser makes for a terrible development workflow. Who wants to write code in a text area field? Yes, <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs/templates/flat_file_templates.html">there&#8217;s a way around it</a>, but even that method comes with its fair-share of issues. It&#8217;s peculiar, but I believe the template model itself, though versatile and dynamic, is the Achilles heel of ExpressionEngine.</p>

<h3>Start your Engines</h3>

<p>Despite some small flaws, ExpressionEngine remains a highly capable, extremely flexible website <abbr title="content management systems">CMS</abbr> solution. Even the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/overview/pricing/">free</a>, Core version packs enough punch to handle a typical blog or small site. I&#8217;ve been using it since version 1.0 (actually, since pMachine Pro), and I continue to be amazed and inspired by each new release.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re considering making the switch, I hope you found this quick introduction motivating enough to get started. I suggest you take the next step and <a href="https://secure.expressionengine.com/download.php?ACT=agreement&amp;id=34">download the Core version</a>. You should also browse the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs">documentation</a> and <a href="http://expressionengine.com/knowledge_base/">Knowledge Base</a>, both of which are well-maintained and written.</p>

<p>In addition, the EE Forums remain the best resource for learning ExpressionEngine, hands down. The support community on the forums is responsive, helpful and passionate.</p>

<p>You might also be interested to know that some highly respected designers and studios already use ExpressionEngine; <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a>, for example. Others include:</p>
