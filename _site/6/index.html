		<h2><a href="/entry/Setting_Up_a_Killer_Local_Web_Development_Environment_on_a_Mac_with_MAMP_an">Setting Up a Killer, Local Web Development Environment on a Mac with MAMP and VirtualHostX</a></h2>
		<p>With a keen sense of internet awareness (Powered by Twitter&#8482;), I&#8217;ve observed a large amount of Switchers <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/other/new-macbook-pro/">whose day job is to build the web</a>. Because of this, I thought I&#8217;d provide a bit of a welcome gift, in the form of a small tutorial on setting up a killer work environment.</p>

<p>The setup I&#8217;m going to describe isn&#8217;t novel, nor is it for everyone. My workflow allows me to have a great deal of flexibility with how I develop (since I&#8217;m basically a one-man-department), so keep that in mind as you read. You may need to &#8220;season to taste&#8221;, so to speak.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<h3>MAMP</h3>

<p>The heart and soul of the environment we&#8217;re going to build comes from MAMP &#8211; Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP. <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp.html">The free version of MAMP</a> contains everything most developers need. Simply download, install and run it as you would any normal application. We&#8217;re going to make a couple of easy changes in the MAMP preferences.</p>

<p>The first is to change the ports that MAMP uses. Click on the &#8220;Ports&#8221; tab and set the Apache and MySQL ports to their defaults (80 and 3306, respectively). You&#8217;ll be prompted for your admin password.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/mamp-ports.jpg" alt="MAMP port settings" border="0" width="359" height="239" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>Secondly, I like to uncheck all of the options in the &#8220;Start/Stop&#8221; section. This comes with some potential performance and security hits since it means you&#8217;ll have to manually stop the servers if/when you&#8217;re not using them.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about any other options. We&#8217;re going to circumvent MAMP&#8217;s default document root with virtual hosts.</p>

<h3>VirtualHostX</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/vhx-icon2.jpg" alt="vhx-icon2.jpg" class="imgright" />Now that we&#8217;re serving Apache+PHP, we can access whatever document root we have setup in the MAMP preference via a web browser with the URL http://localhost &#8211; but that sucks. Instead, we&#8217;re going to use virtual hosts, allowing any URL to any document root we want. That&#8217;s right. Any URL to any directory.</p>

<p>To do this, we can edit the Apache httpd.conf and hosts files manually, or use <a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">Tyler Hall&#8217;s fabulous VirtualHostX</a>, a $19 utility that provides a clean and simple GUI for adding virtual hosts.</p>

<p>On first launch, VHX will ask you to create a backup of the current configuration &#8211; which you should do. It also provides an option for installing MAMP support.</p>

<p>Creating a virtual host is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the domain name you&#8217;d like to use</li>
<li>Choose a &#8220;website folder&#8221; to be the document root for the domain</li>
<li>Apply changes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/vhx2.jpg" alt="vhx2.jpg" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! (You can add advanced, custom directives if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.)</p>

<p>One quick note: anytime you update the virtual hosts you should restart Apache (httpd) by stopping and starting the servers in VirtualHostX (command+shift+R).</p>

<h3>VMware Fusion</h3>

<p>At this point we have a near-perfect local development environment &#8211; except for testing. Sure this works great for testing in all the browsers you have available on your Mac (just type in the domain you chose in VHX in any browser you have installed). But what about testing how your sites look on a PC?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> (or another virtualization program) comes into play. Most of us (developers) already use virtualization in some form for testing, but in order to take advantage of this particular environment &#8211; MAMP with virtual hosts &#8211; we need to update the hosts file on the virtual machine so that it resolves the domains to the Mac&#8217;s IP.</p>

<p>One catch: if you&#8217;re on a latop, chances are the Mac&#8217;s IP will change often. That&#8217;s why we need to get the secret IP the VM uses to talk to the Mac. (Yeah, I didn&#8217;t know such a thing existed either.) Here&#8217;s how we find it:</p>

<p>Type <code>ifconfig vmnet1</code> into a Terminal window. You should get a return like this:</p>

<pre><code>vmnet1: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500
    inet 192.168.115.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.115.255
    ether 00:50:56:c0:00:01
</code></pre>

<p>The &#8220;inet&#8221; number is your &#8220;secret&#8221; IP (in my case, 192.168.115.1).</p>

<p>Now that we have that number, we can edit the hosts file on the VM. We find it in: <code>C:/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc</code>. Just open the host file with Notepad, and add each virtual host (domain) on it&#8217;s own line at the end of the document, like so:</p>

<pre><code>192.168.115.1  dev.triumphofgrace.com
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; and save. Afterwards refresh the VM&#8217;s DNS cache by typing <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> in a command line window.</p>

<p>(Do this for each virtual host you added in VHX.)</p>

<p>Voila! Now you should be able to access the custom virtual hosts you created in VHX on your PC using that wonderful browser we all love, Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3>Recap</h3>

<p>So here&#8217;s what we did, in a nutshell:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/download.html">Download and launch MAMP</a></li>
<li>Change default ports MAMP uses</li>
<li><a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">Download and launch VirtualHostX</a></li>
<li>Backup settings (using VHX&#8217;s startup guide)</li>
<li>Add the virtual hosts we want to use</li>
<li>Restart Apache</li>
<li>Add any virtual hosts we created in VHX to the PC hosts file</li>
<li>Rock on!</li>
</ol>

<p>There you have it. A killer, local development platform on your Mac. Once you have everything setup, you can now install and run your choice CMS (such as <a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=sperte">ExpressionEngine</a>) right on your Mac. How cool is that?</p>

<p>Go forth and make the web a better place.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/tools_for_creation">Tools for Creation</a></h2>
		<p>In case you&#8217;ve been curious, here&#8217;s a few projects I&#8217;ve been busy with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/library">/library</a> &#8211; A promo page dedicated to our new Library.</li>
<li>Implemented jQuery and converted the carousel thingy on our <a href="http://thecity.org">homepage</a> to use jCarousel.</li>
<li>Whipped up a <a href="https://www.thecity.org/groups/new">quick-fix</a> for a <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/90558/">processing error we had</a> with our Groups registration form.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thecity.org">blog.thecity.org</a> &#8211; Moved and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">re-aligned</a> Pastor Wendell&#8217;s blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/big/">/big</a> &#8211; A promo page for the next two weeks and beginning of the Anniversary year.</li>
<li><a href="http://thecity.org/pwp">/pwp</a> &#8211; A promo page for our upcoming conference.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is, of course, a common thread throughout all of those projects: <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>, <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Without them there&#8217;s no way I would have been able to accomplish that list &#8211; in the 8 days I took.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/lines">Lines</a></h2>
		<p>So I just got back from the local Apple Store (empty-handed thanks to their policy about requiring the primary account holder to be present, yadda yadda &#8211; don&#8217;t get me started), and I thought I&#8217;d post this bit of interesting info about people lining up for the iPhone 3G.</p>

<p>It seems that the lines (which, by the way, are <em>still</em> insanely long &#8211; I mean, does anyone else not see how absolutely crazy this is?) are less because of the overall demand and more because of the slow exercise of activating the device. An employee even told me they only had only two personnel assigned to the job of activations, and admitted that&#8217;s the reason for the long waits.</p>

<p>So are they spiting AT&amp;T, or their customers, with that strategy? Two employees? Really, Apple? Do you realize what people are doing for these iPhone thingies?</p>

  <p>Dear Sean,</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for giving up soda and sugar substitutes, that&#8217;s been a huge blessing. Now to business.</p>
  
  <p>I know you&#8217;ve been heavily weighing the option of getting an iPhone 3G on Friday, and have already looked at all the pros and cons. I also know you saved the money from the sale of the &#8211; what was it again? Oh, yeah, the PowerBook &#8211; to purchase it. (Wow, I haven&#8217;t said that name in years. I had to have my Knowledge Navigator look it up for me.)</p>
  
  <p>Well, let me just tell you: Don&#8217;t do it. Skip it. Keep your current iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>You see, here in the future, the only companies that have survived are the ones that look after their customers. While some companies expanded their energy and resources trying to contain handfuls of pirates and scammers, others concentrated on improving their loyal customers&#8217; user experience. Unfortunately, AT&amp;T is not one of the latter type. In classic Galactic Empire fashion, they tightened their grip, and the pirates slipped through their fingers. It drove their cellular division to the ground.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile Apple has been pounding out product after product after product &#8211; with services, too! You should see their new home gardening appliance. Freakin&#8217; awesome. Comes out in time for the Holiday season. But why am I telling you? You don&#8217;t even care about gardening yet.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, I just wanted to give you fair warning. You don&#8217;t want to be locked into AT&amp;T any longer than you have to. They had a good run, but once Apple decided to give them the boot and launch their own communications service platform, it was over. (Truth be told, though, I knew way before then &#8211; when AT&amp;T started courting other manufacturers trying to come up with an iPhone killer. It happens sooner than you think.)</p>
  
  <p>Also, hey, don&#8217;t worry about that rash. It goes away.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,<br />
  Future Sean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what do you think? I say Future Sean&#8217;s an idiot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting an iPhone 3G this Friday.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/mobileme_to_support_personal_domains">MobileMe to Support Personal Domains</a></h2>
		<p>While watching the &#8220;QuickTour&#8221; of Me.com I noticed something on the Account page that piqued my curiosity: A setting for &#8220;Personal Domain&#8221;.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/mobileme-account.jpg" alt="MobileMe Account page" border="0" width="459" height="349" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen this documented elsewhere, so I did a little digging. As far as I can tell, it&#8217;s just a transferred <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Dotmac/Member/en/gen367.html">feature</a> from .Mac; which I didn&#8217;t know existed. According to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1932">this transition FAQ</a>, personal domains already in use with .Mac will carry over and also work with MobileMe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] If you have a personal domain setup for your iWeb site, it will continue to work without changing any settings at your registrar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neat.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/how_i_rate_my_music">How I Rate My Music</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/itunes-playlists.jpg" alt="Screenshot of iTunes Playlists" border="0" width="175" height="177" class="imgright" />A proper (read as &#8220;useful&#8221;) method for rating my music &#8211; with stars, in iTunes &#8211; has eluded me ever since the feature was introduced. Here&#8217;s a new method I&#8217;m trying; which I couldn&#8217;t fit into a 140-character Tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 stars = &#8220;I could listen to this song anytime, in any mood&#8221;</li>
<li>4 stars = &#8220;I love it&#8221;</li>
<li>3 stars = &#8220;I like it&#8221;</li>
<li>2 stars = &#8220;It&#8217;s okay (but I have to be in the mood)&#8221;</li>
<li>1 stars = &#8220;Not a fan &#8230; but I keep it around for some reason&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to rate every song in my library with this system. Unrated songs will be left unchecked, and won&#8217;t play in shuffle mode or get transferred to my iPhone. I&#8217;m starting by rating entire albums, or at least those I can, confidentially.</p>

<p>Coupled with data iTunes records automatically (e.g. play count, times skipped, etc.), ratings can prove very helpful in fulfilling preference. For instance, finding songs that I love but haven&#8217;t played in a while could be as easy as creating a Smart Playlist that matches checked songs that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a rating of greater than 3 stars</li>
<li>Kind doesn&#8217;t contain &#8220;video&#8221;</li>
<li>Last Played is not in the last 3 months (a &#8220;played&#8221; song must play through entirely, I believe)</li>
<li>Last Skipped is not in the last 3 months (for a song to be &#8220;skipped&#8221; it must have played at least 1 second first)</li>
<li>Skip Count is less than 3</li>
<li>Date Added is not in the last 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>That Playlist returned just under 400 great songs I&#8217;d either forgotten about, or haven&#8217;t listened to in months! I&#8217;m rediscovering my music.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/waiting_on_the_macbook_pro">Waiting on the MacBook Pro</a></h2>
		<p><img src="/assets/img/mbp2008-mockup.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro mockup by 'bayol05' of MacRumors forums" border="0" width="250" height="158" class="imgright" />It was with disbelief and frustration that I read this statement in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/02/03/new-macbook-pros-appearing-in-retail-inventory/">an article</a> published on MacRumors ten days ago (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the new MacBook Pros will likely incorporate only modest updates (Penryn and Multi-Touch), with their imminent release, <em>its hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d just hit &#8220;Submit&#8221; on an order for a MacBook Pro just 15 minutes earlier &#8211; after a furious internal debate over waiting or not. I knew revisions for the pro-line machines were coming, but with my current PowerBook G4 (early-2005) acting more like a boat anchor than a productivity tool, and with a demanding work schedule and task-list, I felt I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.</p>

<p>That statement shook me, though. <em>It&#8217;s hard to justify the purchase of the current 8 month old models</em>. It echoed in my head and haunted me for the rest of the evening &#8211; until I decided it was true. It <em>was</em> hard to justify it. In fact, it was too hard, so I cancelled my order.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m waiting, credit card in hand, for &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know. Based on the rumors, it sounds like the new MacBook Pros will have new, Penryn processors, feature the new multi-touch trackpad (as found on the MacBook Air), and possibly have a new enclosure and/or a black keyboard.</p>

<p>To me, none of those items are worth waiting for. Since I&#8217;m upgrading from a PPC G4, I&#8217;m apathetic to a processor update &#8211; I&#8217;d be happy with a 2GHz Core Duo right now. I couldn&#8217;t care less about the multi-touch trackpad. And a new enclosure is actually potentially bad for me, as I&#8217;ve happily touted a 15-inch, aluminum laptop around for years.</p>

<p>So, really, I guess I&#8217;m waiting for two reasons: (1) so I don&#8217;t buy a brand new laptop that is practically obsolete the day it&#8217;s delivered, and (2) in case Apple introduces a next-generation MacBook Pro instead of just a revision to the current one.</p>

<p>At least I don&#8217;t feel alone in my particular campaign. <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4861601#post4861601">Hundreds</a> (if not, thousands) of others are also waiting on the new MacBook Pros. Based on what I&#8217;ve read, these are serious buyers, not just fanboys who can&#8217;t wait to see what Apple has up their sleeve. With the MacBook Air missing a niche market of professional users, you can almost smell the money people are ready to throw at Apple for a new, full-featured laptop.</p>

		<h2><a href="/entry/website_launch_generation_church_conference_2008">Website Launch: Generation Church Conference 2008</a></h2>
		<p>Last night I hit the &#8220;Launch&#8221; button on the [second revision] of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://generationchurch.org/conference/2008">Generation Church Conference mini-site</a>. I really had fun with this one. The design is grid-based, the typeface is Helvetica (Extended), and the navigation is dynamic. 
This project marks the first time I&#8217;ve publicly utilized the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS framework</a> &#8211; which I&#8217;m absolutely loving. Not only did it save me time in development, but it also really helped me keep focus during the design stage. The default 24-column grid provided a construct from which I was able to be creative, but still controlled.</p>

<p>This is also the first time I&#8217;ve launched a website without first testing in Internet Explorer 6. It feels good. It feels <em>real</em> good.</p>
