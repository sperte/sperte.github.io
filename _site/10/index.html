    <p>While deciding on a place to eat lunch, The Wife suggested (in all seriousness) a hot dog vendor located in the middle of <a href="http://www.redmondtowncenter.com/">Redmond Town Center</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;The only time I eat hot dogs is during a sporting event.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could run around RTC,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Rolling my eyes, I replied, &#8220;no, I mean, a sporting event in which I am a spectator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> could run around it and you could watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>We decided on something else.</p>

    <p>Okay <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/show_me_the_virb_knock">my contest</a> didn&#8217;t work out so well. Either a) no one&#8217;s interested in Virb.com, or b) I haven&#8217;t the readership to support a contest to give out invitations to it. The latter I can deal with, and completely understand. The hype surrounding Virb is such, though, that I would think anyone who&#8217;s at all interested in social networking, Web 2.0, independent music, new media or any other buzz word, would be interested in seeing Virb for themselves.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/virbprofile-sneakpeak.jpg" border="0" height="395" width="591" alt="VIRB sneak peak" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>I can only conclude, then, that the cost is perceived as too great. Well, let me fix that: <strong>Want an invite to Virb? Just ask.</strong></p>

<p class="update"><strong>Update:</strong> Still have a bunch of invites, but I&#8217;m going to begin giving them away to people I know off the internets. Now or never, people!</p>

<p class="update"><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://www.virb.com">She lives!</a> VIRB is now open to the public, so go signup, add me as a friend, and commit <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70717-0.html">myspacecide</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/she_said_yes_again">She Said Yes! (Again)</a></h2>
    <p>Valentine&#8217;s Day came and went, and this time <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/headsmack">I didn&#8217;t let it get by</a>. Actually, I was determined I wasn&#8217;t going to strike out this year. I made reservations at the <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/seattlewa/home.html">Melting Pot&#8217;s Seattle location</a> &#8230; nine months ago.</p>

<p>Well, needless to say, since Valentine&#8217;s Day fell on a Wednesday (the same night the church hosts mid-week services), we didn&#8217;t make it, and ended up giving our reservations away to some friends. It was alright though, because the restaurant had an opening the next night, Thursday, at about the same time. I nabbed those reservations and we ended up having a wonderful time &#8211; and paid probably half what our friends were forced to. (You see, restaurants typically limit their menus and drive up their prices for the lovers&#8217; holiday. Suckers in love, I guess.)</p>

<h3>A lost memory</h3>

<p>It was somewhere in between the cheese fondue appetizer and homemade seasoned vegetable bouillon that I realized our engagement website was no longer live. The site told the story of how I proposed on Valentine&#8217;s Day 2004, as recalled by The Wife (then &#8220;Casey Maddox&#8221;), and it including video clips of the entire event. It had been forgotten about during a service switch, I think.</p>

<p>I built the site for family and friends across the country who hadn&#8217;t been able to participate in the engagement festivities &#8211; the after-party or announcement at church &#8211; where the story was verbally told and the video shown. As per the nature of the internets, though, the site got picked up on some popular social blogs. What resulted were some interesting off-site (and off-color) conversations about us and our lifestyle. Whatever. We paid it no mind.</p>

<p>But I still get about one or two referrals to the non-existant site per week. The poor souls who click through only get my homepage &#8230; Well, not anymore.</p>

<h3>Relive the moment</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/shesaidyes_screenshot.jpg" border="0" height="494" width="250" alt="Screenshot of the new She Said Yes! website" class="imgright" />This past weekend I decided I&#8217;d resurrect the site, clean it up, give it a fresh look, and relaunch it. The Wife was gracious enough to permit me to post the video clips on YouTube so we may save bandwidth, and ensure a more compatible deployment across OSes and browsers.</p>

<p>In fact, I just checked out the site using my Wii and the beta Opera browser &#8211; the video loads and plays just fine. Ah! Geekout moment! Embedded Flash video; on my TV; on a website; on my Wii!</p>

<p>Originally the site included some photos and goofy accent graphics (like a Starbucks cup), but I opted against including them in this version. I wanted the story itself to be the main focus. I used Roger Johansson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200609/automatic_pullquotes_with_javascript_and_css/">automatic pullquote JavaScript</a> (the same one I use on this site), and selected a few of The Wife&#8217;s more pertinent statements to feature.</p>

<p>Previously the story was broken up across multiple pages, and laid out using nested tables and inline CSS. Ew! Now the site semantically correct in terms of the markup, and hopefully more lasting because of that. It&#8217;s also limited to just one document/page. We&#8217;ll see how this goes. Hopefully, since the blog revolution, users have been (re)taught that scrolling is a permitted behavior, and perfectly acceptable. The story is short enough that limiting it to just one page seemed reasonable.</p>

<h3>Feedback welcome</h3>

<p>I didn&#8217;t enable any form of commenting system for the site. The reason for that is mostly because it would&#8217;ve taken another level of attention, which translates into another few hours of work. Instead, I opted to direct readers back to this entry. Hopefully this serves a bigger purpose, though, and users become more informed as to the context of the story before commenting. I wholeheartedly welcome feedback, but I&#8217;d prefer if comments were made by people who know me as more than &#8220;the guy in the story&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, I present the resurrected engagement story website: <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/shesaidyes">She Said Yes!</a></p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/show_me_the_virb_knock">Show Me The VIRB: Knock</a></h2>
    <p class="update"><strong>Update:</strong> This contest is dead. I&#8217;m just <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/virb_invites"><em>giving away</em> invites now</a>. Aren&#8217;t I nice?</p>

<p>Welcome to the first installment of the <strong>Show Me The VIRB</strong> contest! Very similar to <a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/?p=4626">Joshua&#8217;s deal</a>, the rules are simple: Show me the <em>verb</em> I want to see, and I give you the <em>VIRB</em> you want to see.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s theme: <strong>Knock</strong>.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><span>Snap a photo illustrating the contest verb.</span></p>

<p>Be creative. It could be you or someone you know performing said verb, or could be the verb from a different perspective.</p></li>
<li><p><span>Upload the photo to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> or your photo-sharing website of choice.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Link to your submission in the comments.</span></p>

<p>Use Textile&#8217;s linking formatting if you want. Example: &#8220;Here&#8217;s my submission&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/your/photo/url</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>top three</strong> submissions will get an invite to <a href="http://www.virb.com">VIRB</a>, as well as fame and glory and their wildest dreams come true<sup>1</sup>. Judging of the submissions will be done by yours truly and The Wife.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you don&#8217;t have the means to take a digital photo, and/or upload it, you can substitute a word-only, essay answer. You&#8217;re required to replace a verb (or number of verbs) from a famous quotation with the theme verb from the contest. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To knock, or not to knock. That is the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230; only it better be more creative than that.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>No offensive or otherwise un-funny submissions will be accepted. The contest will conclude next Sunday, February 25th. If VIRB.com should happen to go live in the middle of the contest &#8230; no hard feelings. No purchase necessary. Void where prohibited.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> I am not responsible for the fame and glory and wildest dreams coming true.</p>

    <p>Apple has just released an update for iTunes. In the release notes it touts its new &#8220;support for the Second Generation iPod shuffle&#8221;. I find that interesting because iTunes 7.0.1 (the previous version) supports my new shuffle just fine &#8211; everything besides the color.</p>

<p>So, what would you expect &#8220;support for&#8221; to mean? Yeah me too. But apparently it doesn&#8217;t. <a href="/entry/reepicheep">Reepicheep</a> is still silver.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/the_making_of_version_3_homepage">The Making of Version 3: Homepage</a></h2>
    <p>My favorite ExpressionEngine customization on Geek &amp; Mild is found on the homepage; the displaying of article and link entries. They&#8217;re both listed chronologically, as you can see, but are displayed uniquely. Out of the box the <code>&#123;exp:weblog:entries&#125;</code> tag doesn&#8217;t have a <code>category_id</code> variable, so I have to query the database to get one. Thankfully <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> does have a query tag so no PHP code is needed. 
Here&#8217;s what I do:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>&#123;exp:weblog:entries weblog=&quot;myblog&quot; limit=&quot;20&quot; paginate=&quot;bottom&quot;&#125;</li>
<li>&#123;exp:query sql=&quot;SELECT cat_id AS mycategory FROM exp_category_posts WHERE entry_id = &apos;&#123;entry_id&#125;&apos;&quot;&#125;</li>
<li>&#123;if mycategory == &apos;#&apos;&#125;</li>
<li>&lt;div class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;</li>
<li>    &#123;if summary&#125;&#123;summary&#125;&#123;if:else&#125;&#123;body&#125;&#123;/if&#125;</li>
<li>&#123;if:else&#125;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#123;entry_date format=&quot;%M %j%S&quot;&#125; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/entry/&#123;url_title&#125;&quot;&gt;&#123;title&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</li>
<li>    &#123;summary&#125;</li>
<li>    &#123;if body&#125;&#123;body&#125;&#123;/if&#125;</li>
<li>    &lt;p class=&quot;post-links&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/entry/&#123;url_title&#125;#comments&quot;&gt;&#123;comment_total&#125; comment&#123;if comment_total != &apos;1&apos;&#125;s&#123;/if&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/entry/&#123;url_title&#125;&quot;&gt;permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>&#123;/if&#125;</li>
<li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;hr /&gt;</li>

<li>&#123;paginate&#125;&lt;p id=&quot;pagination&quot;&gt;&#123;if next_page&#125;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#123;auto_path&#125;&quot;&gt;&amp;#171; Previous entries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &#123;/if&#125;&#123;if previous_page&#125;&lt;a href=&quot;&#123;auto_path&#125;&quot;&gt;Newer entries &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&#123;/if&#125;&lt;/p&gt;&#123;/paginate&#125;</li>

<li>&#123;/exp:query&#125;</li>
<li>&#123;/exp:weblog:entries&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>Firstly, everything&#8217;s wrapped in the <code>&#123;exp:weblog:entries&#125;</code> tag, allowing 20 entries (regardless of entry type, or category), and pagination is set at the bottom. Pretty simple and standard. If you plan on implementing or testing this code block out for your own, just replace the &#8220;myblog&#8221; value with your own blog short-name.</p>

<p>Line 2 is where the query magic happens:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>&#123;exp:query sql=&#8221;SELECT cat_id AS mycategory FROM exp_category_posts WHERE entry_id = &#8216;&#123;entry_id&#125;&#8217;&#8221;&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>Here I&#8217;m grabbing the category ID (<code>cat_id</code>) from the table <code>exp_category_posts</code> for each entry and naming it <code>mycategory</code>. After that I have that precious variable <code>&#123;mycategory&#125;</code> available to me.</p>

<p>Note: I think if multiple categories have been assigned to an entry, every ID will be listed when the variable is parsed. So, for instance, if categories 5, 11, and 14 have been selected, the <code>&#123;mycategory&#125;</code> variable will render <code>51114</code>. I&#8217;m not sure about that since I&#8217;m careful to only assign one category for each of my entries, but you should know if you plan on trying this out yourself.</p>

<p>Now that I have the category ID available as a variable, I use a conditional statement to display entries based on their categories. That&#8217;s where the first <code>if</code> comes into play. My &#8220;links&#8221; category ID happens to be 21, so my conditional looks like:</p>

<ol class="code">
<li>&#123;if mycategory == &#8216;21&#8217;&#125;Content for links&#123;if:else&#125;Content for other types of entries&#123;/if&#125;</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple, eh? Once the initial query is done, the rest &#8230; <a href="http://www.silvermac.com/scrolls-like-butter/" title="Scrolls like butter reference">scrolls like butter</a>, as Steve would say.</p>

<p>One other note about my homepage code: You&#8217;ll notice I don&#8217;t use <code>&#123;url_title_path&#125;</code> for any of my entry links. I opted against that based on the simplicity of my website and the fact that linking to a specific anchor (e.g. #comments) doesn&#8217;t work that well when using the <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> path variables. I&#8217;ll gladly change my ways if someone can explain to me why that is or how to avoid it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It&#8217;s like pulling teeth to get EE to <em>not</em> parse code in this entry! Until I can get it worked out, I&#8217;ve added &#8220;VARIABLE&#8221; to the category ID tag.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: I&#8217;ve changed the variable name altogether.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: Sorry for the outage all day! That&#8217;s what I get for messing around with templates during lunch break. Showing EE code blocks when using the Markdown plugin is proving <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/forums/viewthread/41449/" title="ExpressionEngine Forum thread">more trouble than it&#8217;s worth</a>, but I&#8217;ve been getting help from the pMachine Ninjas. Until a proper solution is found, the code blocks above will be backslash-escaped and have some parsed variables (on the homepage). Best not to copy/paste; just ask me if you want the original source.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong>: Finally got it working! I was provided a new version of the Markdown plugin (much thanks to <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/member/4359/" title="Paul Burdick">Paul Burdick</a>) that encodes EE tags and doesn&#8217;t allow them to be parsed when inside an entry. Certain tags on my homepage still get parsed somehow (notice the <code>&#123;url_title&#125;</code> and <code>&#123;entry_date&#125;</code> tags) because I&#8217;m using query. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a way around that, so I am considering other solutions for displaying linked entries versus other types.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/think_twice_about_buying_an_iphone">Think Twice About Buying an iPhone?</a></h2>
    <p>According to Computer World we&#8217;re supposed to <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9010521&amp;pageNumber=1" title="Eight reasons to think twice about buying an iPhone">think twice about buying an iPhone</a>. They&#8217;ve provided eight reasons, some of which are good thoughts &#8211; but there&#8217;s a lot of misinformation, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the big criticisms of the iPhone is that it will only support 2G data service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it supports 2.5G (EDGE) data and <em>automatically</em> switches to WiFi were available. I guess it&#8217;s just me, but I find open wireless networks just about everywhere I go now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider how cramped that space will be if you want to store and watch video on your iPhone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, consider that, because you can&#8217;t fit nearly as much as you can on your laptop, HDTV or DVD shelving. Com&#8217;on, guys, it&#8217;s a <em>phone</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] if you typically opt for an entry-level or more basic phone, you may find that you won&#8217;t use all of those features</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This under the warning for if you&#8217;re an &#8220;entry-level&#8221; user. First of all, they&#8217;ve obviously forgotten their audience. Secondly, I&#8217;d like to see an &#8220;entry-level phone user&#8221; pick up an iPhone and start to use it compared to picking up, say, a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4001&amp;template=pp1_1_1&amp;zone=pp&amp;lm=pp1&amp;pid=10393" title="Sony Ericsson J110">Sony Ericsson J110</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you need more features or applications on your phone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230; then the iPhone isn&#8217;t designed for you anyway, weirdo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While many smart phones can interact with Exchange servers, the iPhone cannot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Flat-out wrong. Sure they go on to mention the iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;basic POP/IMAP mail access&#8221; on Exchange Servers, but with a statement like that they&#8217;re purposefully misleading people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone announced last month isn&#8217;t likely to be the only iPhone that Apple will produce. It seems almost certain, based on statements from both Cingular and Apple, that future iPhone models will be released [&#8230;]
  If you feel that this first iPhone is too expensive, too limited or just isn&#8217;t for you, keep in mind that over the next year or two, there may be a model that will be more appealing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, good point. If you&#8217;re not an early adopter you may want to sit this one out.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/entitlemint">Entitlemint</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/mintlogo.jpg" height="66" width="63" alt="Mint logo" class="imgright" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.shauninman.com">Shaun Inman</a> recently released a new version of his website stat-tracking software, <a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a>. The upgrade features many new improvements to the previous version, but the bulk of the full version change came in the form of speed increases, a new(ish) interface, and updated default modules (called Peppers). Oh, and it now supports IE PC &#8211; which is perhaps the reason for the influx of crazys on the Mint support forums, but I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. 
Now let me get this out of the way before I go on: Though I own licenses for Mint, and read Shaun&#8217;s blog regularly, I do not know him personally. I think we&#8217;ve had one off-site conversation over email, but that&#8217;s it. Beyond what I&#8217;ve read on his site and what others say about him, I don&#8217;t have any other point of reference with which to judge his character.</p>

<h3>If web developers were sports cars</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote">Let&#8217;s be honest. Shaun&#8217;s work is an inspiration</span>. His designs, software, and methods are all pace-setting. When he uses X and Y, we all &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aah&#8221; and start to use X and Y too. He&#8217;s like a <a href="http://www.threadless.com/submission/49956/the_Future_Pide_Piper">modern pide piper</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I remember first coming across shauninman.com when I was just discovering the Web Standards movement. I learned so much by dissecting his stylesheets and HTML. In a way, he&#8217;s sort of like a mentor to me. Shaun is like the Ferrari of web developers, and I feel like a Dodge Neon compared to him.</p>

<p>Yes, I respect him a lot.</p>

<h3>Bad breath needs Mint</h3>

<p>I guess that&#8217;s one of the reasons I take so much offense when I read <del>responses</del> <ins>knee-jerk reactions</ins> to the upgrade cost (of $19) for the new version of Mint. Enter those crazys I mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think charging customers $19 to upgrade their &#8216;Mint&#8217; software is an absolute joke, and a disgraceful demand on Shaun Inman&#8217;s behalf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to say I&rsquo;m very dissappointed. I love what Shaun does. Great design work. Excellent ideas and awesome developpement. But paying 19$ for an upgrade. I think I&rsquo;ll pass. Sorry Shaun.[sic]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[&#8230;] why should we have to pay for an upgrade to Mint 2? It seems a bit unfair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if Shaun were indebted to those who&#8217;ve purchase his software, and must therefore make good by supplying free support, upgrades and compliments. <em>Riiiight</em>.</p>

<p>I do understand some of the frustration these people have over an upgrade fee &#8211; I&#8217;ve questioned his decision and the cost, too &#8211; but this attitude of entitlement is what irritates me. If anyone has entitlement here it&#8217;s the guy who holds all the cards: Shaun Inman.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s remember, we&#8217;re all using <em>his</em> software. He developed it. He packaged it, and he licenses it. We&#8217;re just users of the stuff, not owners. Hence the license agreement we must agree to before installing it. He&#8217;s not Google, and can&#8217;t just give away the stuff he creates because he&#8217;s floating in a river of income. He&#8217;s a real guy with real needs, wants and feelings.</p>

<h3>Old mints still freshen</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve purchased Mint 2. I did so just last night, in fact. I wanted to track this website&#8217;s stats. Sure I could use one of the other stat-tracker titles already installed on the server, but I wanted something more streamlined and focused. I decided Mint was the perfect product for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also purchased licenses for <a href="http://www.thecity.org">The City Church</a> in the past. I won&#8217;t, however, be upgrading those &#8211; at least not for a while. I don&#8217;t need to. Mint version 1 already does everything I need it to do for those sites. <span class="pullquote">Version 2 offers some great features I&#8217;d love to have, but don&#8217;t need</span>.</p>

<p>The new iPod nanos are pretty sweet, too. Do you think if I complain to Apple that it&#8217;s unfair to charge full price for me to upgrade my first-gen nano they&#8217;ll listen and understand? Doubt it.</p>

<h3>Fresh perspective</h3>

<p>I challenge anyone who feels Mint&#8217;s upgrade price is too steep to take a good, hard look at what they&#8217;re getting for the price they&#8217;re getting it at. Do some comparisons. What can $20 get you?</p>

<ul>
<li>A car wash</li>
<li>A dozen roses</li>
<li>A meal at Red Robin</li>
<li>A pair of cheap driving gloves</li>
<li>A board game</li>
<li>A few days worth of Starbucks</li>
<li>19 songs from the iTunes Store</li>
<li>A DVD</li>
<li>A custom-made hat with your name on it from one of those vendors in the mall</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything in that list you&#8217;d be willing to give up for a software package that&#8217;s well-built, comes with free support, a wonderful development community, and actually <em>does what it says it&#8217;s supposed to do</em>?</p>

<p>I tip my hat to Shaun, and wish him the best of luck with the future of Mint (and other endeavors). That&#8217;s free of charge.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/version_3">Version 3</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/gm-version3.jpg" border="0" height="100" width="263" alt="Geek &amp; Mild Version 3" align="right" class="imgright" />Welcome to Version 3 of Geek &amp; Mild. (If you&#8217;re reading this via RSS feed, you may want to <a href="http://www.seansperte.com">visit and check out the changes</a>!) This version represents the third redesign since the site launched 18 months ago, and but is the first major update in terms of graphics and presentation.</p>

<p>(A big thank you goes to The Wife&trade; for enduring my &#8220;code-comas&#8221; and late nights while I obsessed over the redesign.)</p>

<h3>What remains</h3>

<p>What you won&#8217;t recognize as being new is the format I display entries on the homepage. I opted to stick with the Kottke-/Gruber-esque inline display of both links and blog posts. Now links are identified with a neat, little leaf decoration. Posts are now fully displayed on the homepage, requiring no additional clicks to read to entire article.</p>

<p>I also chose to keep a streamlined homepage design rather than bog it down with needless badges, referrals, widgets and other typical blog paraphernalia. Yes, I added a Flickr Image Stream, but let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves &#8230;</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s new</h3>

<ul>
<li>Graphics, look, feel, etc.</li>
<li>Live comment previews</li>
<li><a href="/archive">Archive section</a>, featuring &#8220;The Last Thirty&#8221;</li>
<li>Beefy footer with Flickr Image Stream and at-a-glance bio</li>
<li>A genuine <a href="/about">About page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously the biggest change is the design. <span class="pullquote">I wanted to go with something bolder, but didn&#8217;t want &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; or 18px Helvetica</span>. I chose black, grays and white because I wanted photos and inline images to pop on the page. The serif type I selected also seemed to lend itself nicely with the plain blacks and grays. I kept the subtle yellowish highlights of previous versions &#8211; I think it was part of whatever &#8220;brand&#8221; had been developed.</p>

<p>Another big update is the implementation of live comment previews. Previously there had been no way to preview your comment before submitting it. That made for unsure interaction with commenting, and caused frustration with the way Textile formatted comments. Now, everything&#8217;s previewed while the user types, even the Textile formatting.</p>

<p>With this version I really wanted to make my archives more readily available. Since Geek &amp; Mild had accumulated 18 months worth of posts, I felt it was worth it to create a stand-alone archives section. The previous 30 posts are listed first, displayed as &#8220;The Last Thirty.&#8221; After that is the Topics and Archives listings.</p>

<p>I admit the archives section is still infantile. Search capabilities are coming soon (I had to launch this version first, in order have a live URL structure to work with), and I&#8217;m brainstorming ways to transition to using tags for easy browsing of relevant interests. Be sure to check back often, as changes to the Archives section will probably be rolled out weekly.</p>

<h3>The technical</h3>

<p>The more I use ExpressionEngine for a variety of different projects, the more I love it. This blog is actually more complicated than it looks in terms of code. Still, the flexibility <abbr title="ExpressionEngine">EE</abbr> provides made <del>creating</del> <ins>revamping</ins> it a joy. My goal is to open up and share the source code, showing how and why each page works the way it does. I&#8217;ll do this over the next few weeks, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, feel free to peruse the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> yourself and ask questions.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/reepicheep">Reepicheep</a></h2>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to my new lil&#8217; friend: Reepicheep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seansperte/378046345/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/378046345_c8567074a4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="3616 Reepicheep" class="imgcenter" /></a></p>

<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reepicheep">Named, of course, after the heroic mouse from the Narnia series</a>.)</p>

<h3>It was meant to be</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d been debating the purchase of one of the new colored shuffles all week (well, since the announcement anyway) and happened by my local Apple Store last night. It must&#8217;ve been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">RDF</a> that sucked me in because five minutes later I found myself back outside the store, iPod shuffle in hand, and $85.95 poorer.</p>

<p>As for my impressions thus far, I can say that I&#8217;m mostly impressed with the accompanying earbuds that Apple has supplied. They are an upgrade to the standard iPod earbuds, and were introduced when the 2nd generation nano was unveiled. They&#8217;re <em>much</em> more comfortable to wear, have a shorter length cable, and have slightly better sound quality. After using them for a full day now I would recommend them to anyone, even for the $29.99 retail price!</p>

<h3>Justification</h3>

<p>You&#8217;re right, by the way, if you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;but don&#8217;t you already have a perfectly good iPod nano?&#8221; <span class="pullquote">The truth is, I have no need for it</span>. Not only do I already own an iPod, but I also intend on buying an iPhone (also a wide-/touch-screen iPod) come June. Even I don&#8217;t need that diverse of a gadget lineup.</p>

<p>Still, therein lies my reasoning. Bear with me here.</p>

<p>The iPhone will <em>replace</em> my iPod nano &#8211; by the way, anyone looking to buy a nearly-perfect, white, 4GB iPod nano? &#8211; and take its place as player for podcasts, favorite songs, and specific playlists. It will also store the latest episode of The Office.</p>

<p>Reepicheep, then, will be my &#8220;work iPod.&#8221; I&#8217;ll load it up at the beginning of my work day with tunes I think fit my mood and will drive my creativity. I tried it out today, and even though the novelty of owning a new iPod affected my overall opinion, I thought it served its purpose great. In fact, I finally kicked out some logo comps that have been months-due. Yay for creativity!</p>

<h3>If only&#8217;s</h3>

<p>Now, if only I could keep the iPod&#8217;s playlist in the source list. To me, that feature was one of the benefits the shuffle models offered. When did that go away?</p>

<p>Also, if only I didn&#8217;t have to use the (included) dock to sync with my Mac. The standard USB connector on the first-gen shuffles was definitely under-appreciated.</p>

<p>And, if only I loved the orange color without condition. I chose orange, but only because it was the new, trendy, cool-kid color. In reality, I would have been just as happy with green, blue or silver. Heck, even the pink one is pretty hot. Like <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/colored_ipod_shuffles/">I said</a>, I want them all!</p>

<p>After all, there <em>are</em> five days of the work week, and I need all the creativity I can get!</p>
