    <p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s humanly possible to go your entire life without having one of those &#8220;doh!&#8221; moments. You know, the ones where you wish you had a time machine and could go back in time to right before you said that stupid thing, or wrote that stupid sentence, or tripped while running to first base on a base-on-balls? Sure, there are some who experience these times in lesser frequency than the rest of us, but it still happens to them &#8230; right?</p>

<p>I bring this up only because even though I recognize this fact, I still live in an ongoing attempt to avoid such moments, yet have recently (seemingly) failed miserably. Whether I&#8217;m just being hard on myself or I am, indeed, becoming a walking, talking nincompoop is uncertain. (I&#8217;ll leave that judgement up to my wife and the rest of the world.)</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">Let&#8217;s just say that if I had that time machine, I&#8217;d be putting some miles on it right about now.</span> 
I&#8217;ll not go into detail (mostly because I still value what dignity I have left), but I will say that as a husband, this year I&#8217;ve basically used up the alloted <em>grace period</em> automatically given to my gender upon marriage &#8230; for a lifetime. Sure, I didn&#8217;t forget the anniversary &#8211; date &#8211; but did I <em>plan</em> anything for it? No. And of course I didn&#8217;t forget her birthday &#8211; it&#8217;s the day after mine &#8211; but did I get her anything? No. <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<p>At work you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d do better, and judging from the outside you could say I&#8217;ve been pretty successful this year: I launched two new websites (<a href="http://www.generationchurch.org">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thecity.org">2</a>), a top-ranked video podcast, and have advanced the media of the church by leaps and bounds. But life at work hasn&#8217;t been all strawberries and cream. My mouth (or fingers, I should say) have landed me in trouble a couple of times, and I&#8217;ve had to apologize, clarify, straighten out and fix more than ever. <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<p>One of those &#8220;doh!&#8221; moments even came today as I was working on a redesign of this site. I happened upon several of my older entries and read them again. Ugh. Do you ever read what you wrote and just hate it? Honestly, if it weren&#8217;t for my commitment to keeping the past in pure form, I&#8217;d go back and rewrite half the entries on this blog! <strong>Headsmack!</strong></p>

<h3>It&#8217;s not that bad</h3>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not having some sort of a masochistic rant-fest here. It&#8217;s not all that bad, and I&#8217;m sure some of you have better (or worse) stories to illustrate the Headsmack Effect even better than I. I&#8217;m really not too tripped up when a &#8220;doh!&#8221; moment happens, and I usually am able to laugh at myself &#8230;</p>

<p>I suppose that&#8217;s mostly because my wife picks up whatever slack I&#8217;ve created, though.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve had it with my RSS feeds. Some are broken, some are too active, some are dumb and others are barely ever updated (<em>nudge</em> Jesse <em>nudge</em>); all are unorganized.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m rebuilding, starting from scratch. Yes, I&#8217;ve actually deleted my entire feed list and am now completely void of updated content! Blogs, articles, news, views, etc. I ain&#8217;t got none! I feel naked, stripped of my dignity and disconnected from society. (Okay, it&#8217;s not that bad.)</p>

<p>What I need from you guys, are suggestions for who/what to add to my new feed list. I like blogs on (web) design, culture, technology, and emerging church leadership &#8211; whatever that is.</p>

<p>Help!</p>

    <p>I guess having <a href="http://www.thecity.org/audio/podcast">two podcasts</a> (one video, one audio) maintain rankings in the Top 100 of Religious podcasts (on the iTunes Music Store) doesn&#8217;t come without it&#8217;s drawbacks. Sheesh!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/bandwidth.jpg" width="275" height="35" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>(That&#8217;s 1.3 <em>terabytes</em>, just so you know.) So, allow me a moment to remind everyone: Podcasts eat a <em>ton</em> of bandwidth.</p>

<p>Thank you, that&#8217;s all.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/widescreen_powerpoint">Widescreen PowerPoint</a></h2>
    <p>In addition to maintaining the multiple websites for <a href="http://www.thecity.org">The City Church</a>, I&#8217;m also responsible for the PowerPoint and media presentations during services. Actually, even though my experience was in web design it was for PowerPoint and graphics that I was initially hired at the church. 
But enough about me, let&#8217;s get to some interesting stuff.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been making the transition to the nearly-standard, widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio for all of our media. Our television shows have been letterboxed (16:9 in a 4:3 frame) since 2002, and most of our promos, spots and internal videos have been in native 16:9 for the past few months. I love the widescreen format. The benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s got 75% more width</li>
<li>It&#8217;s more pleasing to the eye</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the new television standard</li>
</ul>

<p>So it&#8217;s been my goal to figure out how to design and deliver widescreen <em>PowerPoint</em> (which we use for announcements, message notes, and other various presentations), making transitions to and from video seamless, and avoiding scaling or cropping.</p>

<p>The first thing I had to do was change the output of the computer&#8217;s secondary display to a (native) widescreen format. I settled on 1280x768, which isn&#8217;t exactly a 16:9 aspect ratio, but works &#8211; it was the closest setting available. In order to fill the display&#8217;s frame I use a custom page size in PowerPoint of 12.5&#8221; by 7.5&#8221;. This measurement was found by calculating the display width and slide height (<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00566.htm">as outlined here</a>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the standard &#8220;HDV&#8221; preset (in Photoshop) when designing graphics, backgrounds and images for PowerPoint. The preset creates a blank canvas that is 1280x720, 72dpi and has [close-to] standard title and action safe guides already generated. This resolution isn&#8217;t an exact match to my PowerPoint canvas aspect ratio, but it allows me to preview what the final output will be once the graphic is rescaled to the standard 16:9 ratio.</p>

<p>After the secondary display hits the processors (in my case, a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&amp;Q=&amp;is=REG&amp;O=productlist&amp;sku=404200">Folsom ImageProHD</a> for the center screen and a <a href="http://www.tvone.com/c2-5000-main.shtml">tvOne video proc</a> for the sides) I have custom aspect ratio settings of 1.5, which gives the proper 16:9 output to our projectors.</p>

<p>For the plasma monitors throughout the Kirkland Campus I have a scan converter from RGB Spectrum that downscales the PC&#8217;s output to standard definition (I know, I know) composite, which is then distributed through multiple DA&#8217;s and splitters.</p>

<p>The result is a seamless comparison between video and computer outputs. So far I&#8217;m satisfied with the results, although it&#8217;d be nice to be pumping HD video so I wouldn&#8217;t have to downscale my PC image as much.</p>

    <h2><a href="/entry/on_ds_lite_ownership">On DS Lite Ownership</a></h2>
    <p>It&#8217;s been about 6 weeks since I ditched <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/psp/">my PSP</a> and got myself a real game-playing portable device: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ds_lite">The Nintendo DS Lite</a>. How has it held up to my expectations as an admitted non-gamer, gadget-saavy, tech-head? Unbelievably. 
I can&#8217;t stop raving about this thing. From the form factor, to the fun and exciting gameplay, to the incredible ease-of-use, to the awesome feature set (with an almost over-the-counter feel), <span class="pullquote">I&#8217;m quite convinced the DS Lite is a must-have for anyone</span>. I&#8217;m talking to you. Yes, you. You&#8217;re anyone, right? Go now, do yourself a favor, and pick up a DS Lite.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my good friend Matt is. He was a hard-core PSP owner, with tons of games. Shortly after I picked up my DS Lite and showed it off a bit, he sold his PSP and games (plus a UMD movie), and hasn&#8217;t looked back. This is the guy who convinced me to get a PSP and was against me selling it when I did.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my grandma is. She picked up her DS Lite about three weeks ago (by my advice) and now has at least 4 games and some accessories. She just emailed me to ask when I&#8217;d be over to meet her new puppy &#8211; apparently she got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Well my wife is. She actually hasn&#8217;t picked one up yet because we&#8217;re waiting for the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/27/pink-is-the-new-ds-lite/">pink version</a> &#8211; but she asks to play mine all the time. She loves it.</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? Okay, lightning round:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only $130 retail</li>
<li>Games are $35 (when they&#8217;re brand-new)</li>
<li>It supports GameBoy Advanced games</li>
<li>WiFi gameplay supports games against other DS owners with OR without the particular game you have, AND online gaming against people all over the world</li>
<li>Speakers are incredible, with surround-sound like sound</li>
<li>A microphone enables online chatting and fun game features (such a blowing up your balloons in the battle mode of Mario Kart DS)</li>
<li>An easy-to-use system menu with clock, calendar, alarm clock and chatting application</li>
<li>Potential to surf the web (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbSq-tCHXmI">Opera is developing a cool web browser</a>)</li>
<li>Will play (nice) with the up-and-coming Wii console system</li>
<li>Practically zero load times</li>
<li>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q="ds+lite"+accessories&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;Accessories galore</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-second-look.html">Cool video reviews</a> (never saw those for the PSP, didja?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So &#8230; convinced <em>yet</em>? Of course you are. You&#8217;re not even reading this, you&#8217;re on your way to Target or GameSpot to pick one up now, right?</p>

<p><del>See</del> <ins>Play</ins> ya online. (Don&#8217;t forget to practice your <a href="http://www.seansperte.com/entry/snaked/">snaking</a>.)</p>
