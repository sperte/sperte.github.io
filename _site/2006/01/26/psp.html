	<p>I celebrated my 25th birthday Tuesday. Besides a ton of text messages and ecards, it was a pretty uneventful day as far as celebrating. <em>However</em>, The Wife&trade; finally caved and let me get a Sony PSP for my birthday, even though she still says that only &#8220;yucky boys&#8221; have them. (Not that I disagree, I would just like to help change that demographic with <em>my</em> ownership.)</p>

<p>I wish I had time to do a full review, but that will have to wait. The bottom line? Winner. Hands-down, the PSP is a solid piece of hardware.</p>

<p>In the meantime, are there any essential games are peripherals I should get? (I only have Wipeout Pure so far, but LOVE it.)</p>
