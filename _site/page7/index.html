    <h2><a href="/2008/01/23/more_hey_apple_dont_make_me_think.html">More &#8220;Hey Apple, Donâ€™t Make Me Think&#8221;</a></h2>
    <p>Derek Powazek <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/880">is pointing out</a> an oddity found when comparing the interface of Safari on a desktop to the one found on the iPhone. Basically the order of elements in the toolbar at the top of the window is completely opposite &#8211; which forces users to take an extra few milliseconds to process.</p>

<p>Apple has to change this on the iPhone, and soon, in order to unify the two interfaces; but my guess is that they won&#8217;t because the context of the two interfaces differs so much (e.g. desktop versus handheld), and because 4-million-plus iPhones are already floating around. I also wonder how close the benefit-to-detriment ratio is. Have users already gotten used to the refresh button being located to the right of the location bar?</p>

<h3>No, seriously. Stop making me think!</h3>

<p>Stranger &#8211; and of higher priority to me &#8211; is the conflicting behavior of the multi-touch trackpad on the MacBook Air and the multi-touch display on the iPhone. On the iPhone, for example, to <em>advance</em>, you swipe from right to left. <a href="http://movies.apple.com/movies/us/apple/mac/macbookair/2008/apple_macbookair_swipe_20080115_r320-13cie.mov">It appears</a>, though, it&#8217;s the opposite on the MacBook Air! Oh, boy.</p>

<p>I already have a hard enough time switching between the iPhone and my PowerBook equipped with a two-finger sensitive trackpad. In MobileSafari, I swipe from bottom to top to scroll down. On the PowerBook, I do the exact opposite. The first time I accidentally used the iPhone method on my PowerBook, I actually got my hopes up, thinking my trackpad had died &#8211; after all, if that were the case, I&#8217;d be forced to upgrade to a MacBook Pro, right?</p>

<p>And I know I&#8217;m not the only one to deal with this. [Reference link forthcoming.]</p>

<p>I understand this whole multi-touch thing is a new world for Apple, and I&#8217;m willing &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; myself and my time (the seconds-worth it requires) while they work these things out. However, I do hope they understand they&#8217;re training the world to a new interface right now. I wonder, if they&#8217;d been this all-over-the-map with the iPod scroll-wheel, would it be the success it is today?</p>

    <h2><a href="/2008/01/16/my_thoughts_and_reactions_to_the_macworld_2008_keynote.html">My Thoughts and Reactions to the Macworld 2008 Keynote</a></h2>
    <p>The biggest surprise from this year&#8217;s Macworld Keynote was that there were no surprises. It&#8217;s actually quite a conundrum we have here. On the one hand, we all love to hear rumors, predictions and so-called leaked information from Cupertino; but on the other, we love being surprised by announcements we didn&#8217;t see coming. I wonder, sometimes, if part of the latter love stems from a passive, sinister desire to see people proven wrong. Nevertheless, the lid on Apple HQ has been compromised as of late.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m still impressed with how well Steve Jobs presents &#8211; even when we know what&#8217;s coming. If the company is to out-live the man, they must find someone to replace the man, not the position.</p>

<p>But this article is about the products, not Steve.</p>

<h3>Time Capsule</h3>

<p><span class="pullquote">Time Capsule looks to be the best product no one will buy</span>. The idea is right, I just think it lacks the simplistic appeal that it needs. The concept behind Time Machine is making the inherently inconvenient and difficult seem easy (and even fun). Look no further than Time Machine&#8217;s quirky interface to see how Apple is trying to appeal to the average consumer.</p>

<p>But Time Capsule doesn&#8217;t appeal to the average consumer. The people who spend $300 to $500 on a backup solution are already passed &#8220;easy&#8221;. They&#8217;re the guys who&#8217;ve setup scheduled backups and drive redundancy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll sell plenty of units. I just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re sell them to Average Joe; at least not at $300 each.</p>

<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong, though. I can&#8217;t stress enough how important backing up is. If Apple gets my mom to backup, praise the Lord!</p>

<h3>iPhone and iPod Touch software updates</h3>

<p>The iPhone software update had a bunch of new mini-features that probably all deserve some sort of attention and review, but the one that I was most excited about was multiple-recipient SMS.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that sad?</p>

<p>It took 5 months for Apple to finally address this. I literally had a &#8220;what am I thinking?&#8221; moment yesterday as I realized every other mobile phone on the market, from freebies to smartphones, could do what I was so excited I could finally do. Now if we could just get MMS on the thing &#8230;</p>

<p>As for the iPod Touch update, my father in-law had the best response: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have to pay for software updates for my iPod Touch! Where do I swipe?&#8221; Agreed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s $20. It&#8217;s worth it. Get over it.</p>

<h3>iTunes Movie Rentals and the Apple TV</h3>

<p>I have little to say about the iTunes Movie Rentals and Apple TV announcements; though they&#8217;re arguably the highlight of this year&#8217;s keynote. When Apple first introduced TV shows, <a href="http://seansperte.com/index.php/entry/one_more_thing_or_three_or_four/">I knew it was too early</a>. When movies came out, it still felt early. Now? Well, I think we might be getting there.</p>

<p>My wife and I haven&#8217;t rented a movie in months, but we will now. And I&#8217;ve wanted to want an Apple TV since it was introduced last year, but just couldn&#8217;t. Now, though &#8230; ? Maybe so.</p>

<p>Both items are awesome. I anticipate both succeeding.</p>

<h3>MacBook Air</h3>

<p>Two years ago when I said <a href="http://seansperte.com/index.php/entry/why_apple_missed_the_niche/">Apple had missed a niche market</a> by introducing the MacBook, I had in mind a sub-notebook for the professional, mobile user &#8211; someone like me, who prefers to work outside the office. On the surface the MacBook Air looks like it fits that niche.</p>

<p>The product tagline is &#8220;Thinnovation&#8221;, and how fitting it is. Still, with no intention of demeaning the genius engineers who worked on it, I will say this: It appears more innovation was put into making the MacBook Air thin than anything else. In fact, except for the thinness, the dimensions of the MacBook Air hardly reflect &#8220;sub-notebook&#8221; standards. (The thick bezel around the 13.3-inch display doesn&#8217;t help the illusion, either.)</p>

<p>But then again, maybe the MacBook Air isn&#8217;t meant to be a sub-notebook. Actually, I didn&#8217;t hear or see one reference of &#8220;sub-notebook&#8221; during the keynote &#8211; everything was &#8220;thin notebook&#8221;.</p>

<p>So did Apple miss the niche again? Maybe.</p>

<p>When Steve Jobs introduced the MacBook Air, he heralded Apple&#8217;s refusal to compromise in several areas: thinness, display size, keyboard size, and processor speed. While they succeeded in delivering on all of those areas, the processor speed is most certainly a compromise. The MacBook Air peaks at a 1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, nearly half a configurable MacBook Pro. Think about that. <em>Half</em> the speed.</p>

<p>Another head-tilting decision Apple made with the MacBook Air is the hard drive capacity. Why not offer a 160GB model? After all, what is a MacBook Air owner to do with all the TV shows they download from the iTunes Store after they view them? They can&#8217;t burn them to a CD or DVD! I, for example, can&#8217;t even fit my iPhoto library on my 80GB internal PowerBook hard drive. I keep it on an external firewire drive. How would I manage a library this size on a MacBook Air?</p>

<p>More criticism for the MacBook Air abounds; most of which is just typical industry feedback and nearsightedness. Some, though, has validity: the MacBook Air&#8217;s memory capacity, lack of swappable battery, lack of ethernet port, and lack of FireWire ports. What was that you were saying about not compromising, Steve?</p>

<p>The fact is, Apple did compromise on the MacBook Air. It would be impossible not to. Laptops and consumer electronics are all about compromise. The trick is finding the right tension in the <em>manufacturing</em> side versus the <em>consumer</em> side of compromise. Remember, consumers have to make compromises, too.</p>

<p>The 12-inch PowerBook G4 seemed to break the rules, though. It shared all the major features of its big brothers, the 15- and 17-inch models; but it still had smaller dimensions. The compromises were minimal: no back-lit keyboard, less USB ports, no native DVI port. I guess I sort of expected a resurrected 12-inch PowerBook G4. Instead, the MacBook Air feels like a dumbed- albeit slimmed-down version of the MacBook &#8230; last year&#8217;s MacBook.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m torn when it comes to the MacBook Air. It&#8217;s like buying shoes that will be too tight: if you can pull it off, not harm yourself while wearing them, and still get your job done, then do it. Just be sure you bring along a shoe-horn (aka USB hub).</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/12/20/interface_depth_of_field.html">Interface Depth of Field</a></h2>
    <p>All this attention put into so-called usability and OS developers still aren&#8217;t taking advantage of depth of field. Why not, instead of changing colors, borders, and shadows, use a blur technique for inactive windows? It&#8217;s already built into Mac OS (ala <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Image" title="Core Image definition in Wikipedia">Core Image</a>) so why not utilize it? I&#8217;m not a developer, so maybe I&#8217;m missing something.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interfacedof.jpg" alt="Interface depth of field example" class="imgcenter" /></p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have to be much. In the example above I used a value of 0.5 (of Photoshop&#8217;s &#8220;Gaussian Blur&#8221; effect) &#8211; and it&#8217;s almost too much. The effect is visually appealing as eye-candy, yes, but is also useful in determining focus more immediately. Of course, it could even be provided as a user preference, allowing for greater or lesser blur for inactive windows. It could even be applied to the desktop and its icons.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re on the subject of the desktop, another question: Why not allow for a user to evoke ExposÃ©&#8217;s &#8220;Desktop&#8221; state when clicking on [an unoccupied spot on] the desktop? (App idea?)</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/09/27/iphone_update_september_07.html">iPhone Update, September â€™07</a></h2>
    <p>Apple&#8217;s released what they&#8217;re calling the &#8220;September &#8216;07&#8221; update to the iPhone software. Included in the update is the iTunes WiFi Music Store, and the option to set a home-button, double-tap, to a function.</p>

<p>There are obvious speed and performance enhancements (especially with the SMS application launching), and perhaps some bug and security fixes, but I&#8217;m really disappointed there is little attention paid to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0718_glaring_omis.php">glaring omissions</a>&#8221; or <a href="http://seansperte.com/entry/iphone_software_quirks">quirks</a>. For instance, there&#8217;s still no way to send an SMS message to multiple recipients.</p>

<p>Some of my other observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>New calculator icon matches the iPod Touch&#8217;s. Yuck.</li>
<li>Hooray for double-tap spacebar to add &#8220;.&#8221;.</li>
<li>SMS app is faster to launch, but still slow.</li>
<li>Camera still <a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/07/19/the-iphone-camera-problem-green-photos-how-to-fix-more-pictures/">loves green</a>.</li>
<li>Marker Felt is still used in MobileNotes.</li>
<li>Haven&#8217;t been able to connect to the iTunes WiFi Music Store yet. It keeps giving me an error: &#8220;Could not connect to iTunes Store&#8221;</li>
<li>How come <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/">this page</a> isn&#8217;t linked to from apple.com/iphone? (I got to it by manually trying &#8220;apple.com/iphone/wifistore&#8221;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the update feels more solid than 1.0.2, but lacks the new features/apps I was expecting. I mean, I sort of assumed the 4th row on the home screen would be filled, rather than having the iTunes Store icon just sort of sticking out there (they could have at least put it on the left). I guess it&#8217;s only a point update, so I shouldn&#8217;t have set my expectations so high.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/09/27/apple-releases-iphone-1-1-1-update/">MacRumors.com</a> has a comprehensive list of the new features:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store</li>
  <li><strong>Louder speakerphone and receiver volume</strong></li>
  <li>Home Button double-click shortcut to phone favorites or music controls</li>
  <li>Space bar double-tap shortcut to intelligently insert period and space</li>
  <li><strong>Mail attachments are viewable in portrait and landscape</strong></li>
  <li>Stocks and cities in Stocks and Weather can be re-ordered</li>
  <li>Apple Bluetooth Headset battery status in the Status Bar</li>
  <li>Support for TV Out</li>
  <li>Preference to turn off EDGE/GPRS when roaming internationally</li>
  <li>New Passcode lock time intervals</li>
  <li>Adjustable alert volume</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I bolded those items which were probably <em>highly</em> requested. Notice I didn&#8217;t bold much.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/09/22/spam_free_email_redux.html">Spam Free Email Redux</a></h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.masugadesign.com">Ryan Masuga</a> emailed me with a great question about my spam-free email setup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if I wanted to change my private email address a couple months down the line [&#8230;] what would happen to any mailboxes I made for the private1234@ address?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have a good answer for him since I don&#8217;t store my email in boxes or the inbox; instead, I use <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Merlin Mann&#8217;s Inbox Zero</a> methodology, plus a folder in my home directory where I save all archived emails.</p>

<p>Ryan did some research and found his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found that reducing the number of folders I have made things pretty easy, but isn&#8217;t really necessary either. All you need to do is ftp into your site to be able to see the &#8216;home/&#123;youracct&#125;/mail/&#123;yourdomain&#125;/&#8217; directory (I think&#8230;) and within that directory are your mail accounts. Copy mailboxes (I&#8217;m on Apache) from old private email directory to the new private email directory and voila - you&#8217;ve just moved all the mailboxes. You could probably scp these as well, but I&#8217;m not that technically savvy and just copying via Transmit seemed to work OK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy enough &#8211; if you have access to your server mail directories.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/09/06/one_of_a_kind.html">One of a Kind</a></h2>
    <p>I posted a satire &#8220;translation from PR-speak&#8221; article tonight, but couldn&#8217;t sleep knowing I&#8217;d just mocked one of the greatest letters I&#8217;d ever read. I had referenced the letter Steve Jobs wrote to all the early customers of the iPhone, and attempted to humanize his words even more than they already were &#8211; which in of itself proved quite difficult. I couldn&#8217;t sleep on it though, and removed the post just minutes ago.</p>

<p>After laying in bed thinking about it, I realized how unique the really letter was. First, that a CEO of any company would write with such candor and humility is amazing. Jobs has done it before, with his thoughts on DRM, but this was different. He was apologizing; and not privately, but in front of the whole world.</p>

<p>What made the letter even more special was the offer that accompanied it. Consider the statement he made during the music event on Wednesday, that Apple is on track to sell their one-millionth iPhone this month. Now consider multiplying that number by 100. Let&#8217;s just say, for example, that Apple will be giving away 600,000 store credits in the amount of $100 each. That&#8217;s $60M worth of &#8220;sorry&#8221;, and plenty of &#8220;we owe you one&#8221;.</p>

<p>Think about that. What other company has ever come close to voluntarily giving that kind of money back to its customers? Apple truly is one of a kind.</p>

<p>(By the way, I&#8217;d just like to mention that I wrote this entire post on my iPhone.)</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/09/06/its_apple_after_all.html">It&#8217;s Apple, After All</a></h2>
    <p>Some random stories of why Apple is still great, and why the momentary questioning of said greatness I had yesterday was premature at best:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had a friend bring his older iBook to me last week. The hard drive had died and I wasn&#8217;t able to recover it or any of the data. The machine was out of warranty, he told me, but I suggested he take it to the local Apple Store and get their opinion.</p>

<p>When he showed up the Genius recognized him from church and told him they&#8217;d take care of it. Turns out the machine was just a few weeks past its Apple Care coverage expiration, and the Genius was able to &#8220;work something out&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>A co-worker brought his iPod nano to me &#8211; it had a broken screen, and looked like it&#8217;d been sat on. The co-worker swore he didn&#8217;t drop it or sit on it, so I (again) suggested he take it to Apple.</p>

<p>He returned the next day with a smile on his face. Apple had replaced the nano, no questions asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Shea, who lives in Vancouver, Canada, visited Seattle last week and bought an iPhone at a local Apple Store. Yesterday he was &#8211; ahem &#8211; <em>surprised</em> to find out the iPhone&#8217;s price had dropped. Since he was still within the 14 day period, he only needed to return and buy back the iPhone for a $200 credit &#8230; but he lives 4 hours away.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://twitter.com/mezzoblue/statuses/251160812">he Twittered</a>: &#8220;Hi, Apple Store Seattle? Can&#8217;t make it back in, I can haz refund?&#8221; &#8220;Sure, over the phone we can get you back $200&#8221;. &#8220;Yay!&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that we&#8217;ve got all that nasty &#8220;does Apple really care about us, or do they just want to make money?&#8221; garbage out of the way, let&#8217;s get back to those awesome product announcements from yesterday &#8230;</p>

    <h2><a href="/2007/09/05/im_just_a_loyal_user_so_ignore_me.html">I&#8217;m Just a Loyal User, So Ignore Me</a></h2>
    <p>Infatuation is a scary thing. It can drive passion, but it can also impair judgement. In the case of Apple, Inc., it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;ve become more infatuated with their products and business plan than with their users.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m writing this in an admitted state of frustration and confusion at Apple&#8217;s recent decision to drop the price of the iPhone. It&#8217;s not the price-drop itself that I&#8217;m frustrated with, it&#8217;s the timing. It&#8217;s easy for some early adopters to justify the $200 premium we paid, most got theirs on day-one. For those of us who waited a month to six weeks to make the plunge, we just paid an extra 30% for 30 days of iPhone ownership.</p>

<p>If the AT&amp;T rep had told me on July 30th &#8211; the day I got my iPhone &#8211; I could pay $399 on September 4th, or pay an extra $5.50 per day for the next 36 days to have it then, I wouldn&#8217;t have blinked before saying I&#8217;d wait. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t think the iPhone is worth $599 (and thanks, John, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#wed-05-moritz">for the reminder of how supply and demand works</a>), it&#8217;s that Apple doesn&#8217;t think it is; they just told us so today.</p>

<p>So was the iPhone priced too high to begin with? Sure, maybe. But almost half a million people didn&#8217;t think so, and bought the thing despite having never used (or even touched) one. In doing so, those brave people validated all the hype that led up to the iPhone launch; which, ironically, has now enabled Apple to more aggressively price it.</p>

<p>What Apple should do is reward the early adopters. It wouldn&#8217;t take much; something as simple as an iPhone software update that includes the top 5 requests they&#8217;ve received. Heck, I would&#8217;ve even taken a shout out at the media event today. It would&#8217;ve been nice to hear: &#8220;Thank you, by the way, to those who purchased the iPhone prior to today. It&#8217;s because of you that we&#8217;re able to offer it to the rest of the world for this price.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who knows. Maybe Apple does have some plan to make it up to us. I hope they don&#8217;t think the ability to buy music over WiFi is it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A day later, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/">Steve&#8217;s made amends</a>. Told you it wouldn&#8217;t take much.</p>

<p>My 8th round pick is <em>obviously</em> a reach, but I&#8217;ve got a good feeling about DJ this year. I also got a lot of flack for the Santonio Holmes and Charles Woodson picks. Whatever. All the guys had their noses in their dated fantasy magazines while I was busy looking up live and accurate-to-our-league stats on my laptop. One guy (and I won&#8217;t name names) even drafted Corey Dillon (retired), Jared Allen (suspended), and Darrent Williams (dead).</p>

<p>The pick I regret most is the 15th round, Najeh Davenport. In fact, I&#8217;ve already dropped him in favor of Antwaan Randle El.</p>

<p>And I know your asking yourself, &#8220;why&#8217;d he draft 4 QB&#8217;s?&#8221; Good question. Let&#8217;s just say, it was intentional.~</p>
