Currently Chief Product Officer at [Tagboard](https://tagboard.com). I'm a product designer with 20 years experience in web, graphics, desktop publishing, media, and marketing.

My last name is pronounced “spur-tee” (but I don't mind if it's mispronounced). It's French, but I'm actually French-Irish-Jewish &emdash; a mutt of nationalities, really. This is what I look like:

I’m 35 years-old, happily married, and have a <del>three</del> <ins>four</ins> awesome kids. I love my family.

I was born and raised in Colorado and moved around a lot during my formative years, finally landing in Seattle, Washington in 1998. I've been here ever since.

In 2009, I co-founded a company called [Sky Balloon](http://skyballoonstudio.com) with two friends. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time. Our most popular app (with over 300k downloads) is a quick-launch video camera called [Capture](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8).

In 2011, I left my career at [The City Church](http://thecity.org) after almost 12 years to help start Tagboard, a social search and display platform. I help lead the product development team.
