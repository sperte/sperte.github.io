Currently Chief of Staff at [Tagboard](https://tagboard.com).

I'm a designer with 20 years experience in products, media, and marketing.

My last name is pronounced “spur-tee” (but I don't mind if it's mispronounced). It's French, but I'm actually French-Irish-Jewish &mdash; a mutt of nationalities, really. This is what I look like:

I’m 35 years-old, happily married, and have <del>three</del> <ins>four</ins> awesome kids. I love my family.

I was born and raised in Colorado and moved around a lot during my formative years, finally landing in Seattle, Washington in 1998. I've been here ever since.

For almost 12 years I helped lead digital and media productions at [The City Church](http://thecity.org), where I launched several award-winning websites and campaigns, the most notable being "Jesus Is ____", which was [nationally recognized](http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/2011/03/jesus-is/) and inspired dozens of lookalike projects and installations.

In 2009, I co-founded a company on the side called [Sky Balloon](http://skyballoonstudio.com) with two friends. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time. Our most popular app (with over 300k downloads) is a quick-launch video camera called [Capture](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8).

In 2011, I left my career at the church to help start Tagboard, a social search and display platform.
