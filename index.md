Currently Chief Product Officer at [Tagboard](https://tagboard.com). I've been designing and building digital graphics and interfaces for over 20 years.

My last name is pronounced “spur-tee” (but I don't really care if it's mispronounced). It's French--I'm French. Well, French-Irish-Jewish; a mutt of nationalities, really. This is what I look like:

I’m 34 years-old, happily married, and have a three awesome kids. I love my family.

I was born and raised in Colorado and moved around a lot during my formidable years until finally landing in Seattle, Washington in 1998. I've been here ever since.

In 2009, I co-founded a company called [Sky Balloon](http://skyballoonstudio.com) with two friends. We develop iPhone apps in our spare time. Our most popular app (with over 300k downloads) is a quick-launch video camera called [Capture](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-quick-video-camera/id442879059?mt=8).

In 2011, I left my career at [The City Church](http://thecity.org) after almost 12 years to help start Tagboard, a social search and display platform. I help lead the product development team.
