My name is Sean Sperte (pronounced “spur-tee”). I like to solve problems and build systems. For almost 12 years I worked for [The City Church](http://thecity.org) in Seattle in the Communications and Media departments. I also co-founded [Sky Balloon Studio](http://skyballoonstudio.com), a software design company that creates iOS apps. More recently I co-founded [Tagboard](http://tagboard.com), a startup in Redmond, WA.

I’m 33 years-old, married to [Casey](http://twitter.com/caseysperte), and have a three children: a girl and two boys. I live in Kirkland, Washington, on Seattle’s Eastside. I’ve been blogging (here) since 2005, and creating websites for almost 20 years.

### About Geek & Mild

The purpose of this blog is to collect and share things of interest related to design, technology, and media; photos, links, quotes, and thoughts. The name for this site is a play-on-words of “Meek and Mild”. I try to live and write from a place of balance and self-control.
